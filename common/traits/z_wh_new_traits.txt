# File for traits added between major releases.
#
# Adding new traits in earlier files can break existing savegames, since
# traits are tracked by their index and adding one in the middle offsets all
# the ones after.
#
# The traits in here should be moved to their proper place only on new major
# releases where savegame compatibility is not guaranteed.
