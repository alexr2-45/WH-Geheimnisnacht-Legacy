EVTDESCAsnehekharan1;One of your enemies has been foolish enough to try and destroy you. Their actions may have incapacitated you, for a time, but the ancient magic protecting your soul is already at work to bring you back into the land of the living.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsnehekharan01;One of your enemies has been foolish enough to try and destroy you. Their actions may have incapacitated you, for a time, but the ancient magic protecting your soul is already at work to return you to your full strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan1;I will rise again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan01;Nothing can kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsnehekharan2;Through the spells of the Liche Priests and your divine willpower, you've returned, your dessicated body whole again, ready to cast dominion across all that you see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsnehekharan02;Through the spells of your sorceresses and your own willpower, you've returned, your body whole again, ready to cast dominion across all that you see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan2;Rise, my soldiers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan02;At last, vengeance shall be mine!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan3;Your soldiers have returned with rich treasures from the ancient tombs of Nehekhara. Though there was resistance from the local undead, your expedition has bore some results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan3;All mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasnehekharan4;The blasphemous raiders of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have dared to scour your lands, stealing the ancient treasure hidden within the ancient halls of your glorious palaces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan4;Revenge!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan5;The blasphemous raiders of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have dared to scour [FromFrom.GetName], stealing the ancient treasure hidden within your own palaces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan5;Revenge!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan6;[From.GetName] was hiding a marvellous treasure. Scouring the desert allowed your men to return with loads gold, relics and precious stones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan6;All mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan7;The accursed Tomb Kings of Nehekhara have cursed you for desecrating their tombs. Your army is faltering, crumbling under the arcane sickness bestowed unto them, as are your very limbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan7;No! Put it back! Put it back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan12;You've suffered for too long as a prisoner of this unworthy mortal. Though your body may be tied and your servants far away, your wrath shall strike your jailer and punish them for their blasphemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan12;So it shall be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan13;You thought you could lock away an immortal King of Nehekhara with impunity, but [From.GetSheHe] has cast ruination upon you, greying your skin and rotting the bones beneath your flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan13;Nooo!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan14;One of the pretenders has tried to lock you away, far from the throne that rightfully belongs to you. But there are still many servants you could reach with your mind. Slowly, your retainers made their way to your dungeon and allowed you to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan14;Free at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan15;The pretender you decided to lock away has managed to call upon [From.GetHerHis] loyal servants and found a way to sneak away from your dungeons, to plot [From.GetHerHis] campaign for Nehekhara once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan15;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOMAD_UPRISING;Nehekkan Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan16;The Nehekkan tribes in [Root.GetName] will no longer stand for your oppressive rule and have decided to rise up against you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan16;Useless vagrants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan17;The Nehekkan tribes in [From.GetName] will no longer stand for your oppressive rule and have decided to rise up against your vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan17;Useless vagrants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan18;A Nehekkan tribe has sent word to ask permission to freely roam within the province of [Root.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan18;They are free to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan18;I won't allow this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsnehekharan18;No vagrant shall ever put foot in this province for as long as I rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan19;Emissaries from the tribe of desert dwellers you allowed inside [Root.GetName] have been sent to your court, asking for supplies in a period of shortage for their chiefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZsnehekharan19;Just settle down in this land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan19;We can spare something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan19;Get lost, you filthy beggars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan21;For weeks you've received complaints from your subjects regarding the undead troops roaming across your lands on your liege's command. There has been no attack, but the people are unsettled by the skeletons standing sometimes for days, staring at their homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan21;I'll talk with their master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan21;Just pretend they're not there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan22;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent a complaint about your troops. Apparently the glorious armies of Nehekhara stationed to protect [From.GetHerHis] province are unsettling the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan22;I command them to fall back and change their path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan22;I command them to reassure the locals of their good intentions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsnehekharan22;This is no concern of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan23;Luckily [From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to understand the problem and has had [From.GetHerHis] undead troops discretely fall back, pursuing less exposed patrols, hopefully placating the fears of the living.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan23;Good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan23005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent an envoy to thank you for your wisdom regarding the issue of your troops scaring [From.GetHerHis] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan23005;I still don't see what was scary about them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan24;Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has ruled otherwise on your plea to retreat some of the undead from your countryside. In fact, there are now frequent reports of people scared away from the province by skeletons trying to speak with them in hissing voices and dead languages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan24;What are they doing?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan24005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] is still unsatisfied with your solution to the problem of the craven subjects in [From.GetHerHis] provinces. The living keep on mistrusting and shying away, despite your servants' attempts at reassuring them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan24005;Are they hiding something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan25;You thought the worst when receiving news of the undead approaching directly your subjects, but, astonishingly enough, your people managed to find common ground with the creatures and are starting to get along fine with each other, trusting the immortal soldiers to be ever-watchful over their land and possessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan25;Who'd have thought?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan25005;Just as you assumed, it was only a question of showing the integrity and discipline of Nehekharan troops to reassure the people under [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan25005;It's obvious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan26;The response of [From.GetTitledFirstName] was the same as that of [From.GetHerHis] soldier: silence. You keep on receiving complaints about your subjects, but there's not really much you can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan26;Why they have to be so creepy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan26005;Your vassal finally stopped with [From.GetHerHis] meaningless complaints about your soldiers scaring the local populace. After all, if they've done nothing wrong, what do they have to fear about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan26005;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan27;Since you can remember you've heard incredible and terrible stories about your liege lord and the palace of immortal corpses they live in. Now that there's an opportunity to travel there, you're not sure you want to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan27;I'm not scared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan27;Maybe when I'm older...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan28;Amongst the visitors from the lands of the living under your rule, you've been surprised to see a strange creature. Although covered in flesh, it is smaller than any being you remember, be it human, dwarf or halfling, with short limbs and big eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan28;I shall speak with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan28;A creature so small has to be meaningless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan29;The tall and dessicated undead, wrapped in golden robes, is finally in front of you and starts speaking in a strange and hissing voice, despite [From.GetHerHis] mouth hanging still. The creature leans forward, as if [From.GetSheHe] was about to grab you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan29;H-Hello! How do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan29;*Fight back!*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsnehekharan29;*Flee*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan30;Not only you discovered to your surprise that the creature is in fact your vassal, [From.GetSheHe] explained you that [From.GetSheHe] is a child, that's why [From.GetSheHe] is so small. That still sounds strange, you don't remember ever being like that, even when alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan30;At least [From.GetSheHe] can talk properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan30005;In the end the undead just wanted to talk with you, [From.GetSheHe] didn't mean any harm and looked just surprised to know you are a kid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan30005;Just for now, though!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan31;The creature was more dangerous than you realized. When you tried to approach it and see what it was, it screamed something and attacked you, shortly after running away with one of your sacred ribs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan31;Come back here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan31005;The undead guards are still looking for you, but you think they'll be more busy recovering the trophy you snatched from [From.GetHerHis] ribcage to worry about you getting out of this tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan31005;I still showed [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan32;At your very sight the little creature started twitching and, before you could even say something, it was running away, screaming with an high-pitched voice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan32;What the...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan32005;Luckily, you managed to save yourself from the evil undead before it could suck your soul. You'll never return to this cursed tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan32005;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan33;Don't know why, maybe because of the lack of eyes, but the undead lord has ignored you for all the time you've been in [From.GetHerHis] palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan33;Maybe it's for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan34;You've suffered a great shortage of water this year, with many oasis running low or dry. You've tried to plead to your undead overlords, but they've been silent for the most part.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan34;I'll ask directly to my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan34;It's no use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan35;You've received word from one of your Nehekkan vassals. [From.GetTitledFirstName] for some strange reason is asking for a great deal of water for [From.GetHerHim]self and [From.GetHerHis] subjects. You do remember water had no flavour for the living either, so you're not sure why [From.GetSheHe] would need any...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan35;If they want to damp themselves, let them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan35;This is nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan36;Fortunately your liege has seen the desperate needs of your tribe and has sent some of [From.GetHerHis] servants to gather water for your subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan36;The gods be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan36005;Unfortunately your liege has been as silent as [From.GetHerHis] servants and refused to give any help in the search for water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan36005;We'll find something eventually...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan37;You remember enjoying being at a table with friends, partaking in the fruits of the land, when you were alive. Yet all food tastes like ash and all wine like sand. There's no pleasure in feasting and no joy in conversation. Your servants are silent and empty, your lords envious pretenders of past and future generations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan37;I hate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan37;This is just too sad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsnehekharan38;You still have some memories of the days when you were alive, the anger, the passion... Yet all is still and cold now. You rule jointly with another pretender, maybe your new wife could be interested in trying to relive what was like to love a man, however rotten be his corpse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsnehekharan38;You still have some memories of the days when you were alive, the anger, the passion... Yet all is still and cold now. You rule jointly with another pretender, maybe your new husband could be interested in trying to relive what was like to love a woman, however rotten be her corpse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan38;Worth a try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan38;It doesn't matter. I'm past that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsnehekharan40;For some weeks now the pretender you decided to rule along with has started making some strange pressures. You're unsure what could be achieved: besides hardly remembering what's supposed to be done, you're pretty sure whatever you would need are rotting in a canopic jar who knows where...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsnehekharan40;For some weeks now the pretender you decided to rule along with has started making some strange pressures. You're unsure what could be achieved: besides hardly remembering what's supposed to be done, the embalmed and desiccated corpse you 'live' with is not the most inviting creature you'd want to touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan40;Let's give it a try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan40;We're beyond this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsnehekharan41;Despite your best efforts, your spouse doesn't seem to be interested in the least in exploring the old boundaries of marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsnehekharan41;Despite your best efforts, your spouse doesn't seem to be interested in the least in exploring the old boundaries of marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan41;Why not?! Can we not feel alive again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsnehekharan42;You were glad to hear your [GetFromRelation] shares in your curiosity and is eager to try alongside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsnehekharan42;You were glad to hear your [GetFromRelation] shares in your curiosity and is eager to try alongside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan42;Let's get started!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsnehekharan43;Your [GetFromRelation] tried his best, but there was not much to go around with in the first place. A lot of awkward rattling and creaking, faked hissing wailing and dead emotionless gazes. Maybe it wasn't such a great idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsnehekharan43;Ugh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsnehekharan43005;Ugh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsnehekharan44;After last night, whatever memory was left of your past life's sexual experience has gone. In its place a disturbing cacophony of creaking joints, bones and desiccated flesh rubbing on each other and lipless mouths clashing together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAsnehekharan45;You're not sure if what you did with your [GetFromRelation] last night was exactly how the living do. You had to get more imaginative to make up for the missing body parts, but still, it was not bad at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
