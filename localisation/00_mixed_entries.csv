warpstone_blackmarket_desc;The possession of Warpstone in the Empire is forbidden. While the law dates back centuries, it is rarely enforced.

warpstone;Warpstone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
warpstone_desc;Warpstone is very rare, and can be found, smuggled, or brought into the Old World in many different ways. Powdered Warpstone however, is sometimes drawn south from the unnatural winds of the Northern Wastes, carrying with it a furious storm of wild Dark Magic that sows terror and destruction upon many parts of the southern lands. Most Warpstones fall to earth as meteorites from the sinister Chaos-Moon §GMorrslieb§! with the majority of the substance falling into the harsh domains of the Dark Lands. Warpstone can also be formed from a sufficiently powerful current of Dark Magic into small pieces by very powerful Sorcerers or Magicians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CHOSENDUEL;Chosen Duel;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHOSEN.1;The gods have heard your plea, and have answered. Following the instructions delivered in the entrails of your servant, you find yourself in a twisted grove of otherworldly trees. A hulking beast of malformed flesh and bone claws its way through to the clearing and roars a challenge to you. You're not sure if it's a former champion who succumbed to their corruption, or some unfortunate beast that was twisted by the gods, but it's definitely hostile. Defeat the creature, and gain your infamy!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHOSEN.1.a;Charge! For the Dark Gods!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHOSEN.1.b;Perhaps I will come back later?;;;;;;;;;x
VICTORY;Victory!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHOSEN.2;The beast is huge and possesses immense strength, but is slow and witless. It is a simple matter to dodge the clumsy blows and strike it repeatedly as it bellows and lurches at you. Finally, after countless strikes, the creature lets out a forlorn cry and collapses in a pool of its own blood. You emerge victorious, and thus may be granted your gift from the gods...;;;;;;;;;x

lahmian_elite_agent_desc;Elite Sisterhood agents are those most skilled and trusted by the Queen. They are sent on the most dangerous and difficult missions, but they are also a part of the inner circle of the sisterhood - so many Lahmians dream of attaining this coveted title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmian_protector;Lahmian Protector;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmian_protector_desc;Lahmian Protectors are charged with defending the Sisterhoods interests, by deadly force if necessary. Whereas other Lahmians will flee rather than engage in direct battle and give away the presence of the sisterhood, the protectors will stand and fight. Protectors are often human males skilled in the art of war and personal combat, but it is not unheard of for the Queen to give this title to a particularly warlike Lahmian either. Vampire protectors are, after all, likely to be better fighters than mere mortals due to their natural advantages in speed and strength. Some protectors even receive magical weapons and artifacts from the Queen so that they may fight better in the inevitable conflicts with the witch hunters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ulthuan_desc;Ulthuan is a magical island continent, but the great vortex at its heart, which keeps the Winds of Chaos at bay has unpredictable effects on Elves who are all sensitive to magic.

ca_tower_gorgoth;Tower of Gorgoth;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tower_gorgoth_desc;The Tower of Gorgoth rests atop a plateau in a small volcanic mountain range in the southern region of the Dark Lands. Deep within the remains of the long extinct volcano Azgorh, the Dawi Zharr found there to be vast seams of precious minerals. Untold numbers of slaves have been brought here over the centuries, and the mines have developed into an extensive network.  A huge garrison of Chaos Dwarfs keeps vigilance over the tower and the surrounding area with rocket batteries aligned along the ramparts and towers of the citadel.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_black_fortress;The Black Fortress;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_black_fortress_desc;Guardian of the south-eastern teaches of the Chaos Dwarf realm, the Black Fortress is a vast, jagged citadel stained black by the Volcanic fires of the rocky plateau on which it sits. Along with the Tower of Gorgoth, it vies for prominence and power as the second most important fortress-citadel of the Chaos Dwarfs beyond their heartland on the Zharrduk Plain. Unlike the Tower of Gorgoth, the purpose of the Black Fortress is as a purely military outpost, and is headquarters for the Legion of Azgorh. The legion is a mighty standing army which watches over the desolated southern Dark Lands, escorts the far-flung slave caravans through the Howling Wastes and stands as a bulwark against frequent invasions of Ogres, Orcs and worse from the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

chaos_dwarf_sorcerer_desc;The Sorcerer-Prophets are the great masters of the Chaos Dwarf race, directing the labours of their slaves and the conquests of their armies, their sorcerous powers granted by the Bullfather, Hashut. Thanks to their dark patron, they have completely embraced the arts of magic, with a dire price. Since Dwarfs were never meant to practise magic, over time a Chaos Dwarf Sorcerer will gradually turn to stone, starting from their feet, until the entire body is consumed and they becomes a statue.

startup0desc;At the dawn of time, it is said that the two Old Ones battled to decide what would be the laws upon which the Universe revolves. Unable to reach a consensus, they split Reality in half, so that those who sought canon over freedom and their opposites could both be pleased by inscribing their preference upon this magic tablet...\n\nThere are two ways to play the Warhammer mod. Option A: Player cannot marry outside of his race, and no one can switch to another race's religion. Option B: Player only (not AI) can marry outside of his race, and with some notable exceptions, it is possible for races to change religions. Way of Life DLC seductions are also less restrictive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
startup0A;A - I want a purely canon experience;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

temptation.1;The Embrace of Uncle Nurgle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.1_desc;The Plague Father, Fly Lord, Great Corrupter, the Master of Pestilence... Grandfather Nurgle has many titles. Within your very mind and soul you hear the maddened buzzing of a billion flies, and a chorus of choking, coughing voices whispering in your ears. They are calling you to join them in the endless bliss of utter pestilence and decay, to cast aside the facade of health and embrace the utter rottenness that is the inevitable fate of all life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Temptation.1.TOOLTIP1;Father Nurgle loves his children, hehehe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Temptation.1.TOOLTIP2;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] will give me the strength to resist this sickness in my heart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.2;The Seductions of the Prince of Pleasure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.2_desc;Truth, beauty, honour, justice... what do any of these things mean without pleasure? Are not the senses of Man his guide into the divine? Poetry, music, dance, wine, none of it is enough for one of your intellect and needs. Your body and mind yearn for stimulation, to seek out new experiences. You tire of the restraints of so-called "civilised society,and wonder if it might be better to seek out like-minded spirits and experiment with a new lifestyle beyond mere mortal hedonism? Your inquiring mind and almost uncontrollable lust for life leads you to the Forbidden Lord of Excess, Slaanesh, who can offer you all you desire in return for so little?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.2.TOOLTIP1;Ah, what sweet ecstasy is this? I must have more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.2.TOOLTIP2;No, no, I have gone too far... [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] forgive me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.3;The Changer of Ways Calls Ye;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.3_desc;The ignorant masses cling to their Gods and laws, unaware of their own utter insignificance in the grand scheme of things. Civilisations and races rise and fall, the only constant is change - all else is illusion. One of your genius knows that the only way to survive and achieve greatness on this mortal coil is to understand the vast immaterial power of magic, and to use any means necessary to acquire that knowledge. You know that the parlour tricks of the common wizards are merely a pale reflection of the incredible powers that close-minded religious dogma denies to you. In order to better understand the Winds of Magic, and to further your own career, you've considered entering a purely temporary relationship with the daemon called Tzeentch in order to use him for your own ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.3.TOOLTIP1;Knowledge is power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.3.TOOLTIP2;Some secrets must be hidden forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.4;The Eight-Fold Path;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.4_desc;Weakness, all you see around you is weakness and corruption. Peace breeds excess, only war is pure. Every day you spend you long for the clash of arms, the splatter of fresh blood on your face, to see your enemies' homesteads in flames and their warriors in flight. Better that than to forever be surrounded by whining, ungrateful vassals and forced to listen to the false advice of effete scholars and sorcerers. Kill them, kill them all! Khorne, Master of the Skull Throne, calls you to his service. It matters not from whence the blood flows, only that it does.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.4.TOOLTIP1;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD, SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.4.TOOLTIP2;What am I thinking?! I'm a warrior, not a butcher!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.5;The Power of Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.5_desc;Everywhere those in power seek to blind the teaming mass of Mankind to the horrors that lurk just out of sight. The Blood God, the Changer of Ways, the Prince of Pleasure and the Great Corrupter are all names for a unspeakable force that was ancient when the mountains and the seas were young. Fools deny it, but the Ruinous Powers are very real. Those who serve them well are rewarded, or else are damned for eternity. Do you dare sell your soul to Chaos Undivided, the Primordial Annihilator - and risk all for the sake of immortality and an escape from death itself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.5.TOOLTIP1;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap]? Bah, these are the real Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.5.TOOLTIP2;My faith in [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] in unshakeable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.6;The Cult;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.6_desc;You hurry through the streets, scurrying like a common criminal through the backstreets and the slums, a hood obscuring your face from sight. But you are no common thief or mere conspirator, you serve a greater power. You duck and weave your way to arranged meeting place, whispering a password in a forbidden language. Inside, you are greeted by your new brothers and sisters, and after a blood curdling ritual test you are finally inaugurated into the cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# SYLVANIA EVENTS I DONT KNOW IF THOSE ARE CORRECT;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCUDSYL.1;Sylvania is a dangerous place for all live, but a lovely country if you are a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.1;I'll rule on this accursed land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBUDSYL.1;I've found my perfect lair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUDSYL.2;My holdings are suffering from the influence of this accursed land. Dead men refuse to stay in the ground while huge flocks of what look like bats darken the skies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.2;Damn. I can't do anything to stop it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUDSYL.3;With hard work and the blessings of the gods, the lands of Sylvania are approaching normalcy. Crops grow and the peasants live safely under my watch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.3;I'm a great ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUDSYL.4;With my powerful magic, Sylvania is getting stronger. The dead will rise again and more servants will come to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.4;I will live for eternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUDSYL.5;I've not paid enough attention to the care of my land, and now my loyal servants have dispersed, pursued by fanatical zealots and crusading templars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.5;I don't care of mortal affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUDSYL.6;I've conquered this land, and will now fill the ranks of my armies with the dead. I can also draw out the hidden cultists and necromancers that awaited my arrival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.6;I'm unstoppable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUDSYL.7;I've conquered this land, but now I must deal with the mindless undead roaming about, the ghouls infesting the gravesites, and I'm sure there are foul necromancers and lesser vampires hiding amongst my vassals...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.7;I shall prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUDSYL.8;Send money to a loyal Sigmarite to fight the accursed undead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.8;Send the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBUDSYL.8;Don't send the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUDSYL.9;Grand Theogonist [From.GetFirstName] has send us money to fight undead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.9;I'll waste it well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUDSYL.10;What will I do with the money the Grand Theogonist sent me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.10;Hire some adventurers. No one will miss them if they fail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBUDSYL.10;I'll lead a hunting party, it is only right that I deal with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCUDSYL.10;I'll keep the money for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUDSYL.11;A strange hooded man approaches you, offering you his services to fight the dangers of Sylvania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.11;Let him in, as he will serve me well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBUDSYL.11;I don't trust strangers, send him far away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCUDSYL.11;Witch! Burn him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIPOPTCUDSYL11;There is a chance that the man escapes, wounding you in gratitude for your hospitality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#NAMEPSACE = CARSTEIN;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.0.b;No, I'll attack somewhere else.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.0;For too long, you have bided your time. Now your great spell is complete, and you have raised an army of undead to take on what's left of the Empire. Let the blood flow, and let those who will not serve you in life - serve you in death!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.1;Rumours reach you that in Sylvania a vampire lord by the name of Vlad von Carstein has summoned a massive army of undead, and aims to make war on the fragmented empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.10;With the death of Vlad von Carstein, the undead armies he had raised return to the ground, undead no more... there may be hope for the Empire yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.11.b;No, I'll decide my own path of expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.11;Your empire and armies keep growing, and you are ready to move against Nordland, securing that flank against any counter-attack. You raise more undead for your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.12.b;No, I'll decide my own path of expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.12;Your empire and armies keep growing, and you are ready to move against Westerland, in preparation for the final assault against Altdorf. You raise more undead for your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.2;Rumours reach you that in the distant land of Sylvania, a powerful vampire by the name of Vlad von Carstein has summoned a massive army of undead, and makes war on the fragmented empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.3.b;No, I'll decide my own path of expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.3;You have conquered Ostermark. Now you should move west, towards the imperial capitals and cripple the Empire while it is still divided! You raise more undead for your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.4.b;No, I'll decide my own path of expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.4;You have conquered large parts of the empire - now it is time to move further into Hochland, destroying the weaker foes before moving west against the major seats of imperial power. You raise more undead for your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.5.b;No, I'll decide my own path of expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.5;Your empire has grown to a great size now, and you are ready to move towards Middenland, heading for the ancient Imperial capital of Middenheim itself. You raise more undead for your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.6.b;No, I'll decide my own path of expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.6;Your empire and armies keep growing, and you are ready to move northwards, securing that flank against any counter-attack. You raise more undead for your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.7;Vile treachery - you awaken from your coffin one evening, and find your precious ring stolen! You are now no longer able to return from death over and over again, and you may have to slow the rate of your expansion so as to not risk your life...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.8;Rumours reach your realm that the mighty von Carstein ring which made this tyrant unkillable has been stolen, and he has not managed to retrieve it... there is hope now, that he can be stopped.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.9;With the final death of Vlad von Carstein, the undead armies he had raised return to the ground, undead no more... This is a terrible blow, let's hope we can hold the realm together without them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTCARSTEIN.13;Risen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.13;With the power of the von Carstein ring, you are able to return to life despite wounds that would destroy other vampires. This is a painful process, but one your enemies have no counter to!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#NAMESPACE = CHAOS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCHAOS.0;The Everchosen is the champion of all the Chaos gods. You can journey to the Altar of Ultimate Darkness in distant Naggaroth to seek the favour of the Chaos Gods. The stronger the Winds of Chaos are, the more likely they are to give you their mark.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.1.a;I wonder how strong the Winds of Chaos are...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.1;You make your way across the wastes, into the northern limits of Naggaroth, where stories tell of the Altar of Ultimate Darkness. Finally, after many trials, you reach your destination...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.10.a;Yes, I will march alongside the Everchosen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.10.b;No, I will never march with that fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.10;An Everchosen has been selected, and a great war is being prepared. Daemons of the Dark Gods march under their banner - surely you yourself should also march to war alongside this new champion?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.2.a;Yes, I will face their terror even so!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.2.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.2;The Winds of Chaos are weak at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are unlikely to grant you their blessing. Do you still wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.3.a;Yes, I will face their terror even so!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.3.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.3;The Winds of Chaos are only moderately strong at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are less likely to grant you their blessing. Do you still wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.4.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.4;The Winds of Chaos are  strong at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are likely to grant you their blessing. Do you wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.5.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.5;The Winds of Chaos are very strong at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are almost certain to grant you their blessing if you pass their trials. Do you wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.6.a;I will prove myself worthy - charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.6;Upon entering the temple you are beset by nightmarish visions, testing your faith to its very core. Your mind is strong enough to persevere, and finally you come to the test... you must defeat the Champion of the Gods to receive their mark!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.7.a;Urrrghh! No... not ... like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.7;Upon entering the temple you are beset by nightmarish visions, and attacked by daemons of all sorts! You cannot hold on, the Gods are displeased at your trespass, and soon you are surrounded fighting desperately for your life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.8;You have won the duel against the champion, and you finally kneel before the Altar of Ultimate Darkness, and receive the mark of the Dark Gods. 'Rise... Everchosen... and conquer in our name' a terrible unison of four voices growls in your head...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.9.a;Let all bow before the Everchosen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.9;You return to your lands, bearing the mark of the Gods. Across the wastes, word spreads like wildfire: An Everchosen has been selected, and armies of daemons march by [From.GetHerHis] side! They would be fools not to join you now in the coming war...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTHUMANFLAVOR.0.b;I could have done just as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHUMANFLAVOR.0;While patrolling your lands, a courtier won a great victory when cornered by a dozen bandits. [From.GetSheHeCap] slew half of them, and the rest fled. The court is hailing [From.GetHerHim] as a great warrior!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHUMANFLAVOR.1;While patrolling your lands, a courtier was ambushed, but fled and left [From.GetHerHis] men to die! [From.GetHerHisCap] name is in disgrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHUMANFLAVOR.3.a;We must send for a Witch Hunter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHUMANFLAVOR.3.b;No, Witch Hunters cause too much trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHUMANFLAVOR.3;A shadowy group of cultists are alleged to have formed in one of your holdings, performing dark rituals and even summoning daemons if the rumours are true! Your people beg you to root them out, but what can men do against such dark magic?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#NAMEPSACE = KHEMRI;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCKHEMRI.0;You are one of the tomb kings of Nehekhara, a powerful ruler of a long-dead realm whose glories have long since faded. Yet still you endure, still you stand guard over the ancient glories of the past, and perhaps - the future glories yet to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTKHEMRI.1.a;I serve forever, even in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCKHEMRI.1;You are one of the Liche Priests of Nehekhara, a powerful priest watching over the Tomb Kings and their treasures. Your oath compels you to serve eternally, even in death, to advance the desires of your immortal god-kings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCKHEMRI.2;Your dynasty stretches back thousands of years, but most of the ancient kings and queens of your line are asleep in their great tombs. It is time to awaken some of them, so that if you should perish, they can take up the rule of your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#NAMEPSACE = ORCS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCORCS.0;Orc reproduction remains a mystery, but every dynasty needs heirs and these are close kin of yours and will inherit your possessions upon your death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCORCS.1;Orcs and goblins grow in size from the number of battles they have fought in and won. As you have reached the age of adulthood, your size is...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCORCS.2;With each victory in battle, you grow a little in size and strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCORCS.10;Today, your favourite grot dropped your best choppa on his foot when the handle came off...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;
EVTDESCORCS10A;Ya stupid git ruined ma best choppa!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;
EVTDESCORCS10B;ZOG IT!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;

EVTDESCORCS11A;Oi! Dat's mine! Git 'im, lads!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;
EVTDESCORCS11B;Meh, zog it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;
EVTDESCORCS11C;Woit... Lessee wher' 'is stash is...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;
EVTDESCORCS11D;You cunningly tail the goblin back to his stash... As sneakily as an orc can...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;
EVTDESCORCS.12;After a near un-orc-ish display of cunning brutality, you stand before the goblin's secret stash, a pile of pilfered weaponry which must have taken several goblin generations to collect...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;
EVTDESCORCS12A;Da's gonna git me a big bag 'o teef...!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;
EVTDESCORCS12B;Oi'm 'now a few lads who'd loik a gud choppa...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;
EVTDESCORCS.13;In times of war, it's not uncommon for orc shamans to join a Warboss's retinue, so that they may witness their nascent legend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;;

#NAMEPSACE = SUSPICION;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSUSPICION.0;Word reaches you that the people are beginning to whisper - are you in league with the forces of Chaos? People question your righteousness, and this is a dangerous position to be in.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCSUSPICION.2;Word reaches you that the people are almost convinced that are you in league with the forces of Chaos. People question your righteousness. This is a very dangerous position to be in.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUSPICION.3;People still question, but are no longer convinced that you are a cultist or a heretic. Your recent actions seem to have quelled the suspicion surrounding you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSUSPICION.4;Even your own vassals now whisper against you and the stories of your alleged heretical inclinations grow larger with each telling. They have no proof, but you can see it in their eyes that they no longer trust you and even hate and fear you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCVAMPIRE.0;As you are in your liege's court, your liege confront you one evening with a retinue of guards. 'It is time...' your vampire overlord says, '...for you to join me in the darkness...' you can't escape, there is no choice now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.1;This courtier has been turned into a loyal vampire minion now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.10;Your liege is a vampire, so why should you have to suffer and die as a mortal? Why not just join the ruling caste fully, and embrace the darkness in return for life eternal?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTVAMPIRE.11.a;First death, then eternal life, my new minion...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTVAMPIRE.11.b;First death, then eternal life, my new minion...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.11;One of your vassals has asked you for the dark gift, and swears eternal fealty if you would but grant this heartfelt desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.12;Your liege bestows the dark gift upon you, and bids you serve faithfully until the end of your days.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.13;Your liege refuses your request, saying that you are not worthy. Your skills are lacking, and you are too thoroughly unimpressive to join the illustrious ranks of the vampire aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTVAMPIRE.14.a;Make this vampire part of my dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTVAMPIRE.6.b;No, do not bother me with this again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.6;It is often safest to have your highest ranked vassals become vampires themselves, so that they know that their fortunes are tied to your own success. Do you want to start turning your most powerful vassals?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBspleasure101;[From.GetFirstName] has finally started to act properly, surrounding [From.GetHerHim]self with servants and maids to advise [From.GetHerHis] looks, constantly wondering what could improve [From.GetHerHis] features.

EVTDESCCspleasure101;You are seeing some results for your troublesome [GetFromRelation].

EVTDESCDspleasure101;[From.GetFirstName] has started spending some more time checking [From.GetHerHis] hair, choosing some new fabulous clothes under your benevolent guidance, but [From.GetSheHe] shows still too little interest in the process, as if it wasn't the most important thing to worry about during [From.GetHerHis] whole day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure101;As little as it is, [From.GetFirstName] seems to be giving some attention on how to dress and act, but that's no more than the bare minimum one would expect from everyone. There's no passion, no imagination, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't understand the art behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure101;You thought you almost saw [From.GetFirstName] staring at a mirror today, but no such luck, sadly. How can your [GetFromRelation] be still so uncaring about [From.GetHerHis] looks?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure101;Somewhere, hidden under layers of indifference, there might be a sense of aesthetic inside [From.GetFirstName]'s soul. There's still a long way to find it, though.

EVTDESCHspleasure101;How frustrating, your [GetFromRelation] seems to care as little about you as [From.GetSheHe] cares about [From.GetHerHis] looks. There seems to be no way to dissuade the [From.GetFirstName] to even look at [From.GetHerHis] reflection from time to time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure102;How can you possibly reach perfection with the limitations imposed to you by your own body? There must be another way, no clothes, no hairstyle, no demeanor can ultimately hide the small imperfections plaguing your face. They must be carved out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure102;There must be some other way, you already spend so much time to look at your best, but, for all [From.GetHerHis] praise, [From.GetFirstName] still thinks there might be room for improvement. Indeed, it would be shameful to stop now, when you already have such an advantageous starting point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure102;At first it was just to experiment some new stuff, but now it has become more of an habit. You've a newfound interest in yourself, how to better look, how to better act around other people, how to sit, how to stand, how to dress.

EVTDESCDspleasure102;Getting powders and perfumes the likes [From.GetFirstName] cannot stop from suggesting might be too much, but you've found a strange comfort in spending some time at the mirror in the morning, making sure look at your best before meeting your courtiers and friends.

EVTDESCEspleasure102;You barely noticed yourself combing your hair today. All this expectation from [From.GetFirstName] and other courtiers must have sneaked inside your head. Still, there should not be anything wrong with a few adjustments from time to time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure102;[From.GetFirstName] sent you some extremely flamboyant clothes as a gift, hoping they would help you understand the need to take care of your looks. Why does [From.GetSheHe] even care what you look like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure102;[From.GetFirstName] would just not stop praising your looks, swearing a little care is all you need to reach true perfection. It is such a strange attitude, to think wasting so much time and wealth on mere appearances could be worth anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure102;[From.GetFirstName] has kept on bothering you with [From.GetHerHis] empty flattering, still hoping you could pick some interest in the empty praises to beauty and fashion. Sometimes you almost wish you understood what this obsession really meant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure103;It's no use changing details, you need to sculpt a better face for yourself. Only then, you will reach true beauty, only then people will stop snickering at your back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure103;Every time you feel closer to perfection, [From.GetFirstName] is there, ready to prove you wrong, to point out all the things that you missed, all that still needs to be worked on. How could have you been so blind? The change must be radical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure103;Why is it so hard? You can see [From.GetFirstName]'s harsh words were not uncalled for now, you've started looking for new ways to nurture your look, but for any spot you cover, one more springs out of nowhere, one more thing to trim, adjust, replace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure103;You've started giving greater attention to how you look and act around others, but it's still not enough, you can still hear them snickering behind your back, pointing at all the imperfections and questionable choices in attire you've picked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure103;All this sharp comments, even from other courtiers, are really starting to become unbearable. Do you really look so terrible? Maybe you could spend some time improving your image...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure103;You don't really understand [From.GetFirstName]'s attitude. First [From.GetSheHe] spends hours spitting shrouded insults at you, then [From.GetSheHe] starts spewing advices on how to improve your image. Why can't [From.GetSheHe] just think for [From.GetHerHim]self?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure103;[From.GetFirstName] is back again with [From.GetHerHis] cheap shots against you, how out of style are your clothes, how dreadful does your hair look, how much would you benefit from powdering your face. It's such a meaningless concern for you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure103;It's almost laughable how [From.GetFirstName] still is trying to make you feel some sort of shame for your looks and demeanour, as if you would care anything [From.GetSheHe] or any other empty person would think about you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure103;I will change the flesh and reach perfection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure103;I could... spend some more time on this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure103;I still find all this uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure103;Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure104;You cannot bear to be yelled at any longer by [From.GetFirstName], spewing how ugly you are yet. You must take drastic measures now. You must change what nature got wrong and move towards beauty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure104;There was no misunderstanding in [From.GetFirstName]'s yelling this time. Your appearance cannot be improved by things as limited as powders and lotions, it's your very flesh that needs to be treated. Only then you shall be able to reach perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure104;As you leave [From.GetFirstName] chambers after yet another scolding over your sloven looks, you start to understand what you have might be a real problem. You thought you could manage, spend more time, hire some servants to counsel you on the best way to present yourself, but it's clearly not enough. You must be a desperate case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure104;The constant threats of [From.GetFirstName] have been a huge incentive, now you have to spend at least an hour each day on the morning to make sure to look at your best. Even so, that's not even the bare minimum for your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetSheHe]'s insatiable for constant improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure104;You really tried to to be careful, brush your hair and all such frivolous things, but it's still not enough. You were berated once more by your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. What are you supposed to do? Waste days acting like some spoiled princess?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure104;Why is [From.GetFirstName] so upset? It seems like everyday now [From.GetSheHe] has to yell at you for some wrong mannerism or supposedly dreadful hairstyle or any other entirely frivolous matter [From.GetSheHe] may think of. By this point, you wonder if it wouldn't be easier to just entertain [From.GetHerHis] ideas for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure104;[From.GetFirstName] has called you one more time for another harsh scolding over your allegedly absolute lack of fashion, making empty threats against you if you persist to keep such an uncaring behaviour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure104;How dares [From.GetFirstName] treat you like this! Summoning you, reprimanding you for slovenliness and ordering you to do something about it, as if it was any of [From.GetHerHis] business how you look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure104;I will change the flesh and reach perfection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure104;I could... spend some more time on this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure104;I still find all this uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure104;Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure105;[From.GetFirstName] spent quite some time explaining you how [From.GetSheHe]'s not so insecure to be swayed by mere talk about [From.GetHerHis] appearance. There are better things for a man of [From.GetHerHis] stature to do than look frivolous and effeminate, if not outright perverted. It doesn't seem like you'll get anything more from this one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure105;[From.GetFirstName] spent quite some time explaining you how [From.GetSheHe]'s not so insecure to be swayed by mere talk about [From.GetHerHis] appearance. For a woman of [From.GetHerHis] calibre it would be damning to lose your reason for a self-absorbed life of frivolous nonsense. It doesn't seem like you'll get anything more from this one.You're not so insecure to be swayed by mere talk about your appearance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure105;I'm fine as I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure107;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Just the retouching that you needed, a more virile look, the battle-hardened warrior, the scar going just right to emphasize your good features.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure107;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Just the retouching that you needed, a mysterious cut, running just along the right places to emphasize your good features, making you so much more interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure107;Yes, this will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure10705;It is time to see the results of your gracious and just meddling: [From.GetFirstName] is sporting some nice new interesting looks. How much did he scream to gain his new scar, you wonder? Such a great prize, although coming from a complete different sort of battle, of which you are certainly the winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure10705;It is time to see the results of your gracious and just meddling: [From.GetFirstName] is sporting some nice new interesting looks. Normally one would consider such a cut an imperfection, but in the middle of her otherwise plain appearance, it gains such a special quality... In fact you think it might be even giving some value to her other boring features.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure10705;A good work, but perfection has yet to be reached...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure108;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Proceeding further, adding another line, you start seeing your design taking form. You're like a painter, you finally realize. And your face is still such a blank slate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure108;More red!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure10805;What a surprise [From.GetFirstName] revealed himself to be. Here he is, completely transfigured. His face is terrible and in this terror there is something beautiful. Some in the court might think him a madman to do this, but the fact that you alone can truly understand the greatness of his work, makes it even more sublime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure10805;What a surprise [From.GetFirstName] revealed herself to be. Few men would look at her without turning pale. But for you, she's become a forbidden beauty. The mere thought makes your skin crawl with pleasure, to dare looking at the magnificent fruits of your labour...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure10805;Perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure109;The long days of studying in your laboratory, mixing potions and weaving spells have finally come to their fruition. With some last arcane words you drink the philtre and quickly turn to the mirror to watch your skin writhe and change. Now you truly have the perfect form, the kind whose charms few have resisted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure109;Magic solves every problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure10905;[From.GetFirstName] has outdone himself. With his arts, he found a way to use the Winds of Magic as the tools to sculpt his face. Only you can see all which has changed, every little detail. So delicate, yet, on the whole, so radical a change. He'll soon be the envy of many young fops in the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure110;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your health.

EVTOPTAspleasure110;Doesn't seem so unreasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure110;I'll take care of my own body, thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] has become a real glutton, hardly remaining one day without stuffing [From.GetHerHis] face from morning to evening. At the end of the day [From.GetSheHe] needs servants to carry [From.GetHerHim] to bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure111;Now that [From.GetSheHe] started getting a taste of it, your [GetFromRelation] is really appreciating [From.GetHerHis] new diet, carelessly gorging on new delicacies and exotic food every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] has finally started to stuff [From.GetHerHim]self properly, with less encouraging required on your part. Keeping on like this, [From.GetSheHe] will get as plump as you wished [From.GetHerHim] to be.  At the beginning [From.GetSheHe] was a little nauseous, but now [From.GetSheHe]'s started to crave for new dishes and spices every night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure111;Your ceaseless work has certainly resulted in some minor improvement in your [GetFromRelation]'s looks, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't shy from partaking in a large feast once in a while. You can see the first result of your influence in [From.GetHerHis] distended belly and relaxed demeanour, but there's still much to go yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure111;Your efforts managed to get [From.GetFirstName] to assume what you would consider a healthier diet, but this will still not do, [From.GetSheHe]'s still too undernourished, [From.GetSheHe] needs larger meals to recover entirely and gain the more amiable appearance you're looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure111;Paying some kitchen boys to hide some sugar and honey inside your [GetFromRelation]'s bread seems to have been a good idea. [From.GetFirstName] looks already less pale and starving without being any wiser.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] still completely disregards your just concerns, [From.GetSheHe]'s so disgustingly thin, always refusing any delicacy you have the kitchen boys slip into [From.GetHerHis] table. Going on like this [From.GetSheHe] might actually be getting skinnier...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] still completely disregards your just concerns, [From.GetSheHe]'s so disgustingly skinny, you could swear you see bones sticking out under [From.GetHerHis] skin, how could anyone enjoy being such a corpse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure111;*Flatter [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure111;*Shame [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure111;*Bash [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure112;You cannot remember the last time you felt satiated, every second of your waking life is now a constant struggle against the unending hunger [From.GetFirstName]'s honeyed words have bestowed unto you. Luckily, you've found stuffing yourself until you can barely move as a more than pleasant state of being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure112;With your [GetFromRelation]'s kind guidance, your appetite has grown near insatiable. Every dinner is a feast for you and not too rarely you call your servants during the night to ask for more food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure112;[From.GetFirstName]'s insistent suggestions were all that was needed to tease your appetite. You can barely miss a day without trying something new. Your cravings having been refined as well, you can no longer feel content with the frugal meals you enjoyed before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure112;Since you've started following [From.GetFirstName]'s counsel regarding your diet, you've surely felt more relaxed and free in your choice of meals. But your [GetFromRelation] still encourages you each break to try fancy new dishes. At the end of the week you're often feeling bloated and near-sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure112;After [From.GetFirstName]'s numerous concerned talks, you've started to indulge a little every once in a while. Everyone around you swears it has only done good to your health. It's certainly a less stressful attitude, but you still worry it could get out of hand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure112;With all the concerned praise you're receiving about your eating habits, you're starting to wonder if you shouldn't be a little less strict, if nothing for the sake of your health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure112;It's the third time you see [From.GetFirstName] slipping something near your plate. At this point it would almost feel more unsettling if [From.GetSheHe] were trying to poison you. Naturally, [From.GetSheHe] kept on smiling and praising you for your constraint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure112;Does [From.GetSheHe] makes any sense? First [From.GetSheHe] weaves all sort of praises around you, on how virtuous and temperate you are, but then suggest it might be good for you to not starve yourself as much as you supposedly do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure112;More, I want more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure112;Nothing wrong in indulging a little...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure112;This is disgusting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure112;Enough! The mere thought is making me nauseous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure113;You cannot remember the last time you felt satiated, every second of your waking life is now a constant struggle against the unending hunger [From.GetFirstName]'s poisoned words have bestowed unto you. Luckily, you've found stuffing yourself until you can barely move as a more than pleasant state of being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure113;Following your [GetFromRelation]'s veiled complaints, you've abandoned all caution and let your appetite grown near insatiable. Every dinner is a feast for you and not too rarely you call your servants during the night to ask for more food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure113; You can barely miss a day without trying something new. Your cravings having been refined as well, you can no longer feel content with the frugal meals you enjoyed before. And yet, [GetFromRelation] cannot fail to berate you for still being dangerously moderate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure113;Every time you indulge during a large feast, you end up with your belly stretched and with a sleepy disposition, yet when you voice your concerns [From.GetFirstName] is ready to harshly rebuke them, telling you it is your deviant mindset to see sickness instead of average health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure113;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent veiled insults, you've stopped worrying too much about your meals. After all, if people will complain at you for your moderation and the fasting might be damaging your health, why insist?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure113;With all the shameful quips you're receiving from your [GetFromRelation], you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly depriving yourself too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure113;[From.GetFirstName] is back again with [From.GetHerHis] cheap shots against you, suggesting you might have been in some kind of illness or disgrace to deny yourself even the bare amount of food a person needs to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure113;It's almost laughable how [From.GetFirstName] still is trying to make you feel some sort of shame for your looks, claiming you to be obsessed with your figure to the point of starving yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCDspleasure114;With your [GetFromRelation] scolding your for eating too little every night, you've started to ask for larger meals, yet this new diet often leaves you nauseous and tired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure114;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent warnings, you've decided to assume a new diet. After all your health should come before your looks...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure114;After all the times your [GetFromRelation] has yelled and warned you about how dangerous it is for you to keep such a debilitatingly frugal diet, you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly depriving yourself too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure114;[From.GetFirstName] has called you one more time for another harsh scolding over your allegedly absolute lack of judgement, trying to scare you on what the consequences would be for your body if you keep starving yourself as [From.GetSheHe] thinks you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure114;How dares [From.GetFirstName] treat you like this! Summoning you, reprimanding you for unhealthy diet, as if it was any of [From.GetHerHis] business what do you eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure115;But I *am* concerned! Nothing? Fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure117;[From.GetFirstName]'s concerns seemed suspicious at first, but, looking at yourself in the mirror right now you cannot deny they were founded. Your face lost that sickly pale and hollow look, you don't feel tired riding or holding a weapon, everything looks clearer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure117;Feels good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure11705;Your work has given its fruits: your [GetFromRelation] is finally looking less like a shambling corpse and more like a healthy and strong man, one not likely to be knocked over by a gust of wind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure117005;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure118;You fall back on your chair again, gasping heavily, looking down at the bulging belly peeking from your clothes. [From.GetFirstName]'s influence turned you into a morbid slob, with a chin too many, and soft jiggly arms you can barely raise to put more food in your mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure118;After one last exhausting step, you finally reach your chair and sit down, resting your breasts over your belly. [From.GetFirstName]'s influence turned you into a fat cow, your hips have grown so large and plump you can barely move without setting your legs on fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure118;So tired... need a snack...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure11805;The endless indulging has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: from being such a plain forgettable man, he's now become way more interesting and big. The way he slowly changed, one roll of fat after the other, the process itself is an art masterpiece that you had the luck to witness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure11805;The endless indulging has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: she started slowly, gaining inches around her chest and sides, then her face and waist, such a magnificent display of excess and decadence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure119;You smile faintly, nodding to your servants, so that they can shove another batch of food down your throat. You have no longer the strength to move, nor you wish to.

EVTOPTAspleasure120;Well, I do want to look at my best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure120;That's non of [From.GetHerHis] business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure121;[From.GetFirstName] has become a real model, hardly eating during the whole day, often forcing [From.GetHerHim]self to throw up what little went in [From.GetHerHis] stomach. At the end of the day [From.GetSheHe] has barely the strength to drag [From.GetHerHim]self to bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure121;Now that [From.GetSheHe] started understanding the issue, your [GetFromRelation] is really relentlessly following [From.GetHerHis] new diet, eating as little as possible and checking [From.GetHerHis] body constantly for any ill change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Keeping on like this, [From.GetSheHe] will get as thin as you wished [From.GetHerHim] to be.  At the beginning [From.GetSheHe] was a little recalcitrant, but now [From.GetSheHe]'s started to develop a healthy paranoia around [From.GetHerHis] weight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure121;Your ceaseless work has certainly resulted in some minor improvement in your [GetFromRelation]'s looks, [From.GetSheHe] has started to skip meals and throw up entire dishes from time to time. You can see the first results of your influence in [From.GetHerHis] hollowed cheeks and shaking hands, but there's still much to go yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure121;Your efforts managed to get [From.GetFirstName] to assume what you would consider a healthier diet, but this will still not do, [From.GetSheHe]'s still too plump, [From.GetSheHe] needs to eat less if [From.GetSheHe] wants to look properly good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure121;Paying some kitchen boys to hide some bile inside your [GetFromRelation]'s stew seems to have been a good idea, at the very least to start triggering some aptly timed nausea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure121;[From.GetFirstName] still completely disregards your just concerns, [From.GetSheHe]'s so disgustingly round, eating like a disgustingly average slob. Going on like this [From.GetSheHe] might actually be getting fatter...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure121;[From.GetFirstName] still completely disregards your just concerns, [From.GetSheHe]'s so disgustingly pudgy, how does [From.GetSheHe] even carries around that bloated body? How does [From.GetSheHe] even live with the shame?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure121;*Flatter [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure121;*Shame [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure121;*Bash [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure122;You cannot remember the last time you felt real hunger, your perceptions of the world have grown soft and distant since [From.GetFirstName]'s honeyed words have helped you defeat your unhealthy eating habits. You often find yourself coming back after fainting, but it's all good to keep your terrific shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure122;With your [GetFromRelation]'s kind guidance, you've reached a point where you barely have any appetite. Sometimes servants remind you when it's time to eat, but more often than not you purposefully miss their call as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure122;[From.GetFirstName]'s insistent suggestions were all that was needed to quell your appetite. You can barely miss a week without throwing up a meal. You know every small roll of fat still plaguing your body and are evermore determined to cleanse them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure122;Since you've started following [From.GetFirstName]'s counsel regarding your diet, you've surely felt lighter and quicker, receiving all sorts of praise from other courtiers as well. But your [GetFromRelation] still encourages you each break to skip more and more dishes. At the end of the week you're often feeling starved and nervous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure122;After [From.GetFirstName]'s numerous concerned talks, you've started to restrain yourself a little every once in a while. Everyone around you swears it has only done good to your health. You think you're seeing some improvements as well, ignoring the occasional growling from your stomach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure122;With all the concerned praise you're receiving about your eating habits, you're starting to wonder if you shouldn't be a little more strict, if nothing for the sake of your health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure122;It's the third time you see [From.GetFirstName] slipping something near your plate. At this point it would almost feel more unsettling if [From.GetSheHe] were trying to poison you. Naturally, [From.GetSheHe] kept on smiling and asking if you had enough already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure122;Does [From.GetSheHe] makes any sense? First [From.GetSheHe] weaves all sort of praises around you, on how brave you are, not caring for gossip around you, but then suggest it might be good for you to take on a more frugal diet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure122;All good work has good results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure122;I should have more care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure122;This is terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure122;Enough! I won't starve myself to death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure123;You cannot remember the last time you felt real hunger, your perceptions of the world have grown soft and distant since [From.GetFirstName]'s poisoned words have helped you defeat your unhealthy eating habits. You often find yourself coming back after fainting, but it's all good to keep your terrific shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure123;Following your [GetFromRelation]'s veiled complaints,  you've reached a point where you barely have any appetite. Sometimes servants remind you when it's time to eat, but more often than not you purposefully miss their call as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure123; You can barely miss a week without throwing up a meal. You know every small roll of fat still plaguing your body and so does your [GetFromRelation], whose complaints make you evermore determined to cleanse them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure123;Every time you skip a meal or throw up one, you end up weakened and with a foggy mind, yet when you voice your concerns [From.GetFirstName] is ready to harshly rebuke them, telling you it is your deviant mindset to see sickness instead of average health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure123;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent veiled insults, you've started worrying a lot about your meals. After all, if people complain there must be something wrong, you might be endangering yourself as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure123;With all the shameful quips you're receiving from your [GetFromRelation], you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly indulging yourself too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure123;[From.GetFirstName] is back again with [From.GetHerHis] cheap shots against you, suggesting you might have been starved as a child to develop such a unhealthily robust appetite now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure123;It's almost laughable how [From.GetFirstName] still is trying to make you feel some sort of shame for your looks, claiming your carelessness may very well lead you to disastrous consequences for both your health and your popularity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure123;All good work has good results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure123;I should have more care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

You often find yourself coming back after fainting, but it's all good to keep your terrific shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure124;Following your [GetFromRelation]'s harsh scolding,  you've reached a point where you barely have any appetite. Sometimes servants remind you when it's time to eat, but more often than not you purposefully miss their call as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure124; You can barely miss a week without throwing up a meal. You know every small roll of fat still plaguing your body and so does your [GetFromRelation], whose harsh berating make you evermore determined to cleanse them all. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure124;With your [GetFromRelation] scolding your for eating too much every night, you've started to ask for smaller meals, when not skipping them altogether, yet this new diet often leaves you weakened and nervous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure124;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent warnings, you've decided to assume a new diet. After all you should care about keeping a healthy look...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure124;After all the times your [GetFromRelation] has yelled and warned you about how dangerous and shameful it is for you to keep such a debilitatingly indulgent diet, you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly eating too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure124;[From.GetFirstName] has called you one more time for another harsh scolding over your allegedly absolute lack of judgement, trying to scare you on what the consequences would be for your body and your reputation if you keep stuffing yourself as [From.GetSheHe] thinks you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure124;How dares [From.GetFirstName] treat you like this! Summoning you, reprimanding you for unhealthy diet, as if it was any of [From.GetHerHis] business what do you eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure124;All good work has good results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure124;I should have more care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTCspleasure124;Enough! I won't starve myself to death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure125;[From.GetFirstName] spent quite some time explaining you how [From.GetSheHe]'ll no longer pay attention to your words and your attempts to sway [From.GetHerHim]. Seems clear [From.GetSheHe]'s will not fall for your 'concerns' about [From.GetHerHis] health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure125;But I *am* concerned! Nothing? Fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure127;[From.GetFirstName]'s concerns seemed suspicious at first, but, looking at yourself in the mirror right now you cannot deny they were founded. You feel lighter, look fit and athletic as you never thought possible and have no more trouble walking, let alone breathing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure127;[From.GetFirstName]'s concerns seemed suspicious at first, but, looking at yourself in the mirror right now you cannot deny they were founded. You can finally wrap your hands on your waist without drowning your fingers in rolls of fat and have no real trouble walking up stairs any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure127;Feels good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure12705;Your work has given its fruits: your [GetFromRelation] is finally looking less like a bloated slob and more like a healthy and strong man, one not to to crush horses under his behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure12705;Your work has given its fruits: your [GetFromRelation] has stopped looking like a fat cow and more like a woman someone could find desirable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure127005;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure128;You look at your reflection once more, searching for imperfections. There's not many of them any more. With the help of [From.GetFirstName] you've gained a body any mortal would be jealous of. Sure, some may say you look a bit pale and shaky, but it's merely the price for what you've reached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure128;You toss away another dress, another of your favourite has become too large for you. You have not much use for so-called 'curves' any longer, thanks to [From.GetFirstName]. You're in such a shape to be the envy of all the women in the realm. It needs to be properly admired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure128;But always be vigilant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure12805;The endless fasting has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: from being such a plain and forgettable man, he's refined his body, tossing away all the rough matter, exalting his true essence. The way he slowly changed, every ounce of flesh removed after the other, the process itself is an artistic masterpiece that you had the luck to witness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure12805;The endless fasting has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: she started slowly, losing inches around her chest and sides, then her face and waist. She's become such a delicate and beautiful flower, ready to be plucked. Her frailty makes her even more precious at your eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure12805;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure129;You look faintly at your reflection, ignoring the food laying beneath your bed. It's smell disgusts you, but you have no longer the strength to move. Yet, you look so slim and beautiful now. There's not an ounce of fat in all of your body. You could count your bones, if your mind wasn't clouded by the deprivation [From.GetFirstName] persuaded you into.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure12905;Why did you ever doubt yourself? You thought [From.GetFirstName] could never grow smaller than he already was, but you underestimated your skills and his determination. What a delicate thing he has become, almost a different creature, an otherworldly being which walks alongside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure130;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your behaviour.

EVTOPTBspleasure130;That's sick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure131;[From.GetFirstName] has really become insatiable, trying new games and new players nearly every night, exploring new uncharted heights in pleasure and pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure131;[From.GetFirstName] fully understands the game and, although [From.GetSheHe] has yet to master it, [From.GetSheHe]'s grown knowledgeable enough to tire even yourself. You can finally run wild with your imagination on [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure131;You can finally enjoy [From.GetFirstName]'s full attentions, while helping [From.GetHerHim] finding more friends to spend the night with and new toys and games to play with. It might be the good time to push for something more extreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure131;You think your influence is finally catching on with [From.GetFirstName]. There's still a long way to go, but [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem repulsed by your ideas as before. If nothing else, you've sparkled [From.GetHerHis] curiosity, maybe even actual interest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCFspleasure131;[From.GetFirstName] is still persisting in [From.GetHerHis] prudish attitude. What charm could possibly erode such a stubborn fool and let [From.GetHerHim] understand the true joys of passion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure131;[From.GetFirstName] still remain the most virtuous and intransigent of the people you know. It seems like [From.GetSheHe] think of [From.GetHerHis] integrity as a badge of honour [From.GetSheHe] doesn't want to lose, rather than a shackle to be discarded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure131;[From.GetFirstName] still remain the most virtuous and intransigent of the people you know. Why does [From.GetSheHe] even care so much about a part of [From.GetHerHis] body which apparently [From.GetSheHe] never even use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTCspleasure131;*Traumatize [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure132;The fires of lust blazing within your soul could ignite a forest, there seems to be nothing that can sate your cravings. Every time you feel like you've reached the pinnacle of pleasure, you find a new, higher mountain to climb. And it's all thanks to [From.GetFirstName]'s gentle care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure132;Only a few people understand there is a point where pain and pleasure meet, the dull masses dismiss such claims out of fear and ignorance. But not you. Your nights spent with [From.GetFirstName] opened your eyes more than they ever were. Along with other things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure132;Now that [From.GetFirstName] showed you this new world, you crave to go deeper. You often find yourself letting your mind go adrift during your waking hours, thinking of strange and exciting new ways you could spend the night. And of who else you'd want to share it with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure132;You failed to be strong, but just for a night. [From.GetFirstName] had been so kind to you lately, and [From.GetHerHis] promises looked so alluring...

EVTDESCEspleasure132;[From.GetFirstName] has been so nice with you lately, regaling you with improbable tales of [From.GetHerHis] exploits, jokingly wondering where you could gain some to tell [From.GetHerHim] in return.

EVTDESCBspleasure133;This whirlwind of lust, plots and betrayals is something wonderful, a great gift from [From.GetFirstName]. It's such an exciting and dangerous life, every second of every day. And when one of the two prevails, such marvels are done upon the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure133;Another poisoned drink and you wake in [From.GetFirstName]'s dungeon. It doesn't bother you that much any more. Keeping your guard up, concocting some ploy yourself, seeing who will fall first, it's an exciting foreplay of its own kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure133;You could not prevent yourself from falling to your [GetFromRelation]'s trick, and when you woke up you were bound and naked in the grass, far away in the wilderness.

EVTDESCEspleasure133;[From.GetFirstName] has given you a lot of attention lately, asking strange things, inviting you to seemingly harmless trips and so on.

EVTDESCBspleasure134;Savagery and passion entwined in the last days as you and [From.GetFirstName] explore new depths. You're no longer content waiting [From.GetHerHim], sometimes it is you know to prepare the ambush, sometimes not even against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure134;An ambush in the bedroom is a good starting thrill, but can become dull when repeated to time. Fortunately [From.GetFirstName] knows this.

EVTDESCDspleasure134;Finding a stranger within your own chambers in the middle of the night could upset anyone, but, once your [GetFromRelation] is done with you, you aren't sure of how to feel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure137;Every woman is a new conquest, a new opportunity to experiment, explore. [From.GetFirstName] has taught you much, but there's much more that even [From.GetSheHe] doesn't know.

You're horrified to feel your manhood shrivel into nothingness, but the worse comes last, when the wicked spell plucks away your marvellous beard, leaving you with a shamefully clean chin.\n  The touch of Chaos has warped you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure171;At first the changes are small, with your voice changing oddly, then an uncomfortable creaking as your bones shift and muscles stretch. You look horrified at your breasts shrinking down on your chest while you something starts slithering between your legs. Finally, a long and bristly beard sprouts from your chin and cheeks, growing long enough to cover your now-flat chest.\n The touch of Chaos has warped you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure171;You've felt strange in the last days, but when you awoke this morning you realized your genitalia had change considerably and your chest slightly filled itself. \n The touch of Chaos has warped you into a woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCGspleasure171;At first the changes are small, with an itching sensation, then an uncomfortable creaking as your skeleton warps and rearranges itself. Finally your manhood shrivels away, your horns follow swiftly, shamefully leaving you the clean head of a female.\n The touch of Chaos has warped you into a man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure171;At first the changes are small, with an itch in your skin, then an uncomfortable creaking as your ribcage and shoulders bend and widen while the hip bone narrows. When the horns and the male genitalia appear, you wonder if the sorcery was not in fact a blessing.\n The touch of Chaos has warped you into a man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIspleasure171;At first the changes are small, with your voice shifting pitch, then an uncomfortable creaking as your ribcage and shoulders bend and warp while the hip bones find a new shape. You look confused at the pair of breasts filling on your chest while you feel your manhood shrivel into nothingness. From years your people berated you for being a man, now Chaos blessed you with womanhood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCLspleasure171;At first the changes are small, with your voice becoming somewhat different, then an uncomfortable creaking as your ribcage and shoulders bend and shift while the hip bones rearrange.

EVTDESCslunacy2;What was that shadow? You could have sworn you heard someone whispering behind your back. Why would someone follow you in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy2;A plot?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy3;People suffer all the time, but why care? As long as you are alright, there's nothing to be sad about. In fact, how could you consider yourself well-being, if not by comparison with those who are not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy3;Their suffering makes me feel better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy4;All this stress plaguing your mind is just too much. You need something to calm yourself, anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy4;Some herbs might help, maybe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy5;Incompetent narrow-minded fools might play safe with magic, but you know better by now: one cannot truly master the Winds without taking a few risks. This last experiment might really help you better understanding the arcane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy5;Let's start now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy6;As you expected, the experiment was successful. Each day your mind opens more to the great secrets of the universe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy6;I must know more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy7;You spent an entire night of work for nothing: the secret of this spell still eludes you. All the time wasted for a failure is driving you mad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy7;I need to start again! I must know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy8;Collateral damage is inevitable when fighting for control over the great powers of the universe. You just hoped the fire wouldn't spread to yourself as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy8;Aaargh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy9;This is the last time you have to wake up with a damning headache without remembering what you did the previous night. Alcohol is poison and you shall not submit your brilliant mind to it ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy9;I've better things to think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy10;Nobody is truly ever evil, the more you think about it. All people have good reasons for their actions and those who are said to be wicked are just sad and lonely being, who were probably abused when young. Why should you add to their misery by branding them as villains?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy10;There is no evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy11;You've always known to be special, but you are certain now that the Winds of Magic flow through you, granting you powers that mere mortals only dream of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy11;I'm a powerful mage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy12;Most people don't see it, but in the end isn't life one big joke? You can see it now, it might be you just have keener senses or maybe you're the protagonist of this farce. Why else would other people not see the hilarity in murder or the humour in misery?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy12;Ah ah ah ah ah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy13;For sometime now hardly anything has been able to trigger a response for you. As time passes by not only you do not feel any passion left for your loved ones nor hatred for your enemies, your very skin has started to lose any perception.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy13;I feel... nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy14;Life is something miraculous, when you take one, you can feel all of the vibrant passions and dreams of a dying soul. It lasts but a moment, it's never enough to sate your thirst for death. And off you go, searching for the next target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy14;The blood calls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy15;People have always had to look up on you, they know you're better than them in every way and so do you. Are you even one of them, you wonder? Perhaps you are something more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy15;...more than a mortal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy16;You couldn't help it, it was such a beautiful scene... The body moves now, but soon your blade shall turn it into a motionless puppet and shall be able to watch as the soul passes away into the Realm beyond...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy16;Soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy18;The crazed [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has viciously killed your [GetFromRelation]. Rumours say the horrible murder was entirely without motive but the killer's sick pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy18;Madness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy19;A single soul is not enough to satisfy you tonight: the will of the Great Reaper pervades you and within a week you've left a trail of blood and mangled corpses all over your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy19;Pile the bodies, create a canal with their blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy20;A single soul is not enough to satisfy you tonight: the will of the Great Reaper pervades you, you summon the Winds of Magic at your fingertips and with a few words an entire building explodes, dragging into oblivion countless lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy20;Kaboom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy21;The crazed [From.GetFirstName] has employed [From.GetHerHis] terrible magic to blow up a building in [From.GetHerHis] own lands, killing many of [From.GetHerHis] subjects in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy21;Madness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy22;Why should the thief be hanged when he only stole out of hunger? Is it his fault if he was born poor? Why should the murderer die? Wouldn't that make the executioner a murderer as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy22;Nobody should get punished, ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy23;There was a time when you revelled in other people's suffering, but, the more you look back at those days, the more you feel as if those people only deserved your pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy23;Those poor souls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy24;You just visited your dungeons and saw a prisoner laying, chained on the wall. Why should anybody suffer like that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy24;You'll be freed at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy25;With real power running through your veins you finally realize how deluded you were: only *now* you are a real mage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy25;This is amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy26;Even the most powerful wizards make mistakes from time to time. You were sure the potion would react well to your spell, but something might have gone wrong and the philtre just exploded into your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy26;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy28;That disturbing smirk, it unsettles you. [From.GetFirstName] has spent a good chunk of [From.GetHerHis] day mocking you and laughing, claiming your mind has turned into mush and you're no longer good for anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy28;This is the third time this week [From.GetFirstName] mocks and trips you, [From.GetSheHe] thinks the ailment affecting your body is something hilarious, the cynical freak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslunacy28;You still have the laughter of [From.GetFirstName] echoing within your mind alongside that maniac's cruel quips on your painful disfigurement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslunacy28;[From.GetFirstName] decided to spend [From.GetHerHis] morning chuckling behind you, poking at your sides and making fun of your generous figure, one shaming snark after the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslunacy28;[From.GetFirstName] decided to spend [From.GetHerHis] morning chuckling behind you, obviously pretending to be concerned about your frail health, not sparing jokes about you being skinnier than a shadow, barely capable of walking two steps without crumbling for exhaustion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFslunacy28;This is the third time this week [From.GetFirstName] mocks and trips you, [From.GetSheHe] thinks the illness weakening your body and plaguing your mind is something hilarious, the cynical freak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslunacy28;Has [From.GetFirstName] no heart at all? Your pregnancy is a nightmare as it is without [From.GetHerHim] making fun at you with [From.GetHerHis] cruel jokes, patting your womb and scaring you with all the possible ways your labour could go wrong for both mother and child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslunacy28;As if it wasn't enough trouble for you as it is, [From.GetFirstName] spent last evening cracking jokes about the corruption which is devouring your body, as if your mutations were a light topic of no real importance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslunacy28;What goes [From.GetFirstName]'s mind? The disturbed freak spent all day pointing and laughing at you as if *you* were the insane maniac in the room, rather than [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy28;Enough! Stop it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy29;Watching that miserable fool [From.GetFirstName] trying to get back at you is almost as hilarious as [From.GetHerHis] irredeemably broken mind. You can't stop to chuckle at the thought of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy29;All broken and sore, [From.GetFirstName] is such an easy target. The way [From.GetSheHe] walks, or tries to, it's the most humorous thing you saw in the week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslunacy29;Rarely one has the benefit of entertaining himself with such a fantastic opportunity as [From.GetFirstName]'s mangled body. Tearing scabs off [From.GetHerHis] scourged skin it's just the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslunacy29;How can so few laugh at [From.GetFirstName]? A land whale such as [From.GetSheHe] is, slobbering over the palace all sweaty and bloated... It just calls to be pranked upon, yet people still think you are at fault, for some reason...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslunacy29;How can so few laugh at [From.GetFirstName]? That frail little thing, with [From.GetHerHis] skin barely covering [From.GetHerHis] bones... It just calls to be pranked upon, yet people still think you are at fault, for some reason...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFslunacy29;Making fun of an ill person like [From.GetFirstName] has double the fun: not only you have to think of new quips to make at [From.GetHerHim], you have to keep a safe distance to avoid sharing [From.GetHerHis] state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslunacy29;Why do other people have to always treat pregnant women with such care, as if they were something precious. Making fun at [From.GetFirstName] swollen body and sickly disposition gave you the best time of this month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslunacy29;Small imperfections are already quite enough a cause for mocking, but a full blown third eye or fifth limb? [From.GetFirstName] just called for it. If [From.GetSheHe] didn't want to be made fun of, [From.GetSheHe] shouldn't have gotten the Dark Gods' attention, it's just that simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslunacy29;[From.GetFirstName] is as crazy as it goes. There's barely any point in mocking [From.GetHerHim], in the end. What else can you say that everybody hasn't thought of already? Still, that does make it quite a challenge to tackle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy29;AH AH AH AH AH AH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy30;What do you have to fear any more? No word or action can make you cry, no wound can inflame your mind with pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy30;Nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy31;Even if somebody was conspiring against you, what would be the result? A dagger through your heart feel less than the morning's air to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy31;I don't care any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy32;You're just so desperate to *feel* something. You thought a blade could pierce deep enough to trigger some response, but, despite your efforts and all the blood spilled, no pain reached your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy32;Is there any point in closing these wounds?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy33;You are marvellous and powerful god, it is time that your people started to treat you as such. They have to bow down and worship you, build statues in your honour, pray for you to judge mercifully their souls once they're dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy33;You are beautiful and powerful goddess, it is time that your people started to treat you as such. They have to bow down and worship you, build statues in your honour, pray for you to judge mercifully their souls once they're be dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy33;Bow before me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy34;Sigmar might have ascended in the long past, after he left this world, but you are a god now, divine blood ruling over this lands. Why should you bow down to one who is your equal, if not inferior to your might?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy34;The gods rule from afar, rarely ever talking to their followers, all the gods except you. Your worshippers can see you, they can hear your terrible voice and heed to your commands. Why should you bow down to those who are your equals, if not inferior to your might?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy34;I am your Lord and Master!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy35;What even is love? You do not remember any more, nor you feel any passion left for those who claim to love you in return. There's no point in keeping such a charade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy35;I do not love you, nor anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy35005;So far has [From.GetFirstName] descended into madness that [From.GetSheHe] has entirely forgotten what it means to love and be loved. Now [From.GetSheHe] feels nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy35005;The one I loved is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy36;All the anger, all the hatred, they're gone. In the past the mere name of this person would have inflamed your heart, but now, it is not even worth of your attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy36;I have neither enemies nor friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy36005;[From.GetFirstName] has been your rival for a long time, but now the affliction plaguing [From.GetHerHis] mind has wiped away any of [From.GetHerHis] emotion towards you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy36005;I still don't like [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy37;You've had friends in your life, but now the boundaries of camaraderie have been dissolved. You do not feel like you share anything with this person any more, nor the past experiences mean anything to you any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy37;You are no longer my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy37005;There was a time when you enjoyed [From.GetFirstName]'s company, but now [From.GetSheHe] has grown cold and detached. There's no friendship or interest left within [From.GetHerHis] mind for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy37005;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsuccghrond14;With the death of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] the Druchii Sorceresses of Ghrond have elected another to lead their cabal: [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsuccghrond14;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsuccghrond3;The Sorceresses of Ghrond seem to be mostly approving of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. While not a certainty, [From.GetSheHe] may well be the next to rule over the cabal of Ghrond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsuccghrond3;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsuccghrond4;The dreaded black tower of Ghrond has been home of Druchii Sorceresses for millennia. The old elven hags study magic and plot for power within its walls. It's unlikely for a Druchii to rule over them without their approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsuccghrond4;Hmpf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1202;Are the creatures tearing reality and coming into your world, or are they a figment of your own imagination, created by the substances running through your veins? In either case, their mere sight is too horrifying to handle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1202;AAAAHH!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1203;When you lay down, your mind filled with the strangest stuff, you ponder over the mysteries of the universe. It is amazing what a new perspective can do to widen a person's mindset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1203;The music... of the universe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1204;A thousand enemies hide behind your very shadow. Every time you enhance your senses you can almost see them, lurking outside of reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1204;We must be prepared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1205;Taking a few spoonful of dust is just what you need to calm yourself and let all the worries of the world pass away as your mind is populated by the strangest things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1205;Hello, guys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1206;You must have more stuff, your reserves have been almost entirely depleted, but the supplier is having a hard time finding any new batch this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1206;I don't care how much it costs! Just find more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1206;The waiting is killing me!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1207;It has been sometime since beer and wine lost much of their appeal to you. They all taste stale and you cannot bear the headache coming after each drinking night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1207;I've better things to consume...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1208;Is this even a life? Waiting from one dose to the other, unable to relish any event without your mind being clouded by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1208;No more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1208;I can't... stop it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos1;That's it,no more buildings! Get my horse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos2;A servant comes running at you, screaming the ground has turned into a giant mouth and started taking bites off one of your buildings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos2;That... is expected?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAmagicpotential3005;Something to ponder about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialA4;Luckly the strange sensation is nothing but a far away twitching at the border of your consciousness. You've hidden it, isolated it... You know that it's bad news and you must keep it under wraps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialB4;Luckly the strange sensation is nothing but a far away twitching at the border of your consciousness. You've hidden it, isolated it... You know that it's bad news and you must keep it under wraps. When magic is concerned, it's better to keep quiet about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialC4;Since your childhood you've felt the Winds of Magic and instinctively tried to influence their flow. This experience has never failed to scare you, almost as much as what could possibly happen to you if you were not accepted by society because of your powers. You've thus decided to keep your potential hidden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialD4;Even when your eyes are closed you can still see the Winds of Magic flowing through the world. Such is your potential in magic that you've already managed to warp reality through your will a couple of times. You can barely help yourself to not do it, but you must. You fear what would happen to you if your secret was to be discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential4;Why me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialA5;Luckly the strange sensation is nothing but a far away twitching at the border of your consciousness. You've hidden it, isolated it... You know that it's bad news and you must keep it under wraps from the courtiers and, most of all, your liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCmagicpotentialD6;Since your childhood you feared your predisposition to magic would have betrayed you someday. And today that day has come: your liege has found out about your gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential6;Wait! I can explain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialA6005;It was hard to spot, but you are certain now your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has some faint connection with the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialB6005;It was hard to spot, but you are certain now your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has some connection with the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTCmagicpotential6005;He might be the Chosen One! Kill him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential6005;This is not a concern of mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential4;I don't care! I won't hide who I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential7;You think you've discovered sound proof of witchcraft perpetrated in the county you're hunting in. It is time to confront the perpetrator of these foul and diabolic rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential7;I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential8;The Witch Hunter [From.GetFirstName] has come to you, accusing you of worshipping the Ruinous Powers and drawing from the nefarious Winds of Magic to perform dark deeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential8;*Appeal to liege*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential8;*Banish the Witch Hunter*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCmagicpotential8;*Imprison the Witch Hunter*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential9;The Witch Hunter [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has accused your [GetFromRelation] -[From.GetTitledFirstName] of meddling with the forbidden lore and casting evil spells in [From.GetHerHis] private time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential9;Burn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential9;I shall be merciful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCmagicpotential9;You shall be thrown in the darkest dungeon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential10;You've finally been discovered for what you are. The Witch Hunters have found out about your dark tidings and your forbidden knowledge and have sieged your palace by surprise, with the help of your liege, to drag you on the stake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential10;I curse you ALL!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WITCH_WITCH;Witch!! Witch!! Witch!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential11;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was burned at the stake on charges of witchcraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential11;I don't care about these things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential11;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.18;You've discovered another amongst your servants, [From.GetTitledFirstName], who thought he could secretely practice the dark arts to grow more powerful than you and kill you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_druchiiinv.18;There is no doubt about it: your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] shows the gift of a sorcerer-to-be. Why else would he have hid this from you if not to plot against your throne?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.18;I shall not die by your sorcery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdruchiiinv.18;The prophecy must not be fulfilled. Not even by you, my son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.19;The Witch-King discovered of your meddling with the dark arts and has quickly sent his best assassins to deal with you. Before you can even react, the shadowy druchii sink their blades in your back time and again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.19;Hhhggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GHROND;Ghrond;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic2;By decree of the Witch King all women who show the potential for sorcery must turn themselves in so as to be properly trained in Ghrond, where they study the lore of dark magic in one of the six Covens founded by Morathi. They shall take no man nor bear any children and will live on only to serve the Witch King as his spiritual brides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic2;I will relinquish my possessions and go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdarkelfmagic2;No! I can still hide it... Keep on living like this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic2005;Your attempt at hiding your potential in magic could not go unnoticed forever to the eyes of Naggaroth. The servants of the Witch King have discovered your secret in the end and forced you to go to Ghrond, as it is your duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic20005;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic3;Your daughter shows talent for magic, she has therefore been sent to Ghrond to study with the Covens of Morathi. This is a great honour for your house, as she will now become a bride of the Witch King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic3;A great honour indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic4;Another daughter of a noble house has been recognized as a potential apprentice and has been sent to Ghrond to receive proper teaching and become a Sorceress of the Covens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic4;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic5;The trials of Ghrond are harsh and unforgiving. Only the most gifted and cunning amongst the druchii summoned will manage to achieve mastery over the dark powers and claim their place as Sorceresses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic5;I must keep learning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAdarkelfmagic6;You've spent years in the dark tower and all your hard work has finally paid off. You have taken your rightful place as a bride of the Witch King, a Sorceress of the Coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBdarkelfmagic6;Despite your best intentions, you have not managed to pass all the trials and the ruling hags of Ghrond have not deemed you worthy of taking place amongst them. Bound against your will, you shall be turned into a mindless servant, only employed to satiate the Witch King's lust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic6;So I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdarkelfmagic6;Gooooohhh...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic6005;Your daughter has shown herself to be worthy of the title of Sorceress. She has taken her place within the Covens, bringing more honour to your great House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic6005;Good for her. And for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic6006;Your daughter has disgraced herself: she was not able to pass the final tests to become a proper Sorceress and has now been reduced to a worthless mindless slave in the Witch King's harem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic6006;Disgusting child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HOETH;Hoeth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic2;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] thinks you show talent in magic and has signed you up to study with the Loremasters of Hoeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOTAhighelfmagic2;A great honour!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic3;Every Apprentice in Hoeth has to dedicate himself to countless hours of study to assimilate the centuries of knowledge accumulated in the great libraries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic3;I'll do my best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic4;The scion of a noble house shows talent for magic and has been sent to be taught amongst the Loremasters of Hoeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic4;We will welcome this new apprentice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhighelfmagic5;The your long years of study have finally paid off. You can feel the magic within you and have been officially recognized as a respected Asur Mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBhighelfmagic5;Despite your efforts, Magic just doesn't seem the right path for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic5;I will use these powers wisely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBhighelfmagic5;I tried my best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic5005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has achieved [From.GetHerHis] goal and graduated from Hoeth as an official Asur Mage, a prestigious accomplishment for [From.GetHerHim] and your House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic5005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic5006;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] was unable to reach [From.GetHerHis] full potential and, after a series of mishaps, has been expelled from Hoeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic5006;You're a disgrace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10001;A foul Sorcerer has come to your lands, claiming to have had visions of your future victories from the Gods. The wandering traveller is willing to settle in your court in exchange for a meagre price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10001;You are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice10001;We have no such money to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10002;A Shaman has come to your lands, gaining some favour amongst the locals. The soothsayer is willing to join your court and provide their services for a meagre price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10002;You are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice10002;We have no such money to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10003;A mysterious visitor from the deserts has come to your court. Apparently he is a famous scholar from a faraway land, gifted in the arts of magic and he'd be willing to stay and offer his services to you for a meagre pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10003;You are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice10003;We have no such money to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10004;A travelling Witch has decided to settle at your court. She has requested a few things for her stay, but there's no way of you to refusing her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10004;You... are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice2;Your guardian has the reputation of a powerful magician. And being in the company of such an individual has made you wondering if you could become a mage as well, when you grow up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice2;Can you teach me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice3;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has expressed a desire to learn magic from you as your apprentice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice3;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice3;Not a chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice4;You're taking too long. Perhaps you do not have the gift of magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice4;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice5;[From.GetFirstName] does not think you have what it takes to wield magic and has dismissed your request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice5;But I do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice6;You've been delighted to know your [GetFromRelation] was quite happy to take you as [From.GetHerHis] apprentice and teach you in the ways of the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice6;Yes! I won't disappoint you, I promise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice7;Teaching someone how to feel and channel the Winds of Magic is no easy task. What do you want [From.GetFirstName] to be taught?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice7;I'll teach [From.GetHerHim] about caution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice7;A mage must keep an open mind and experiment new things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice7;One cannot channel the arcane powers without focus and discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice7;It is time to test [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice70001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you of how a mage should be cautious. Of how tricky and deceitful daemons are and of how so easily a spell can turn in a catastrophe fore everyone involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70001;I'll try and be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice70002;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you of how a mage should be bold and inventing. Of how you shouldn't just learn from [From.GetHerHim], but search your own knowledge and create new ways of turning the Winds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70002;I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice70003;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you of how a mage should never lose his calm and maintain absolute discipline at all times, for it is a vital component for casting even the simplest spell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70003;I'm trying to, really!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice70004;You've spent years over dusty tomes and stinking potions under your [GetFromRelation]'s tutelage, but it has all paid off: you can feel the magic inside you and call it through your will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice70004;You've spent years over dusty tomes and stinking potions under your [GetFromRelation]'s tutelage, but it was all for naught: you're no closer to casting the first cantrip as you were when you started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70004;This is just the beginning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice70004;Why can't I do it?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice8;Your work with [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has paid off: [From.GetSheHe] has started casting [From.GetHerHis] first spells without any help and is likely to go on [From.GetHerHis] studies without need of your tutelage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice8;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice80005;It seems your [GetFromRelation] has succeeded in [From.GetHerHis] apprenticeship and is now a fully qualified mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice80005;A great accomplishment for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice80006;Your work with [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been in vain: [From.GetSheHe] doesn't appear able to call for the Winds of Magic and might as well have no power at all in [From.GetHerHis] blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice80006;What a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice80007;It seems your [GetFromRelation] has failed in [From.GetHerHis] apprenticeship and is unlikely to ever become a mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice80007;What a loss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice9;The Winds of Chaos will favour only the chosen ones of the Gods. To prepare [From.GetFirstName] [From.GetSheHe] must give in to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and his unholy worship and live by his tenets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice9;I will speak to [From.GetHerHim] of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice9;I will teach [From.GetHerHim] the tenets of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice9;All the same, [From.GetSheHe] needs to learn of incantation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice9;I feel the Gods will soon test [From.GetHerHis] resolve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending quite a lot of time talking about someone called the Changer of Ways and of how he could grant you infinite powers beyond your imagination, if only you were to forsake the faith of your ancestors and embrace him as your only Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending quite a lot of time talking about someone called the Lord of the Flies and of how his warm embrace could grant you great powers and a safe haven from pain and death, if only you were to forsake the faith of your ancestors and love him back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending quite a lot of time talking about someone called the Dark Prince and how he could make you feel better than you ever did in your entire life and show you marvels beyond your comprehension, if only you were to relinquish the faith of your ancestors and bow to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90001;Seems a good bargain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice90001;No, I don't like him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90002;[From.GetFirstName] has finally accepted of how only Tzeentch can lead [From.GetHerHim] to the true mastery over the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90002;[From.GetFirstName] has finally understood and welcomed the unconditioned love of Papa Nurgle in [From.GetHerHis] heart, hoping to receive his gift in return soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90002;[From.GetFirstName] has finally felt Slaanesh's touch and yearns for more, aware of the uncharted heights of pleasure [From.GetSheHe] has still to reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90002;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90003;[From.GetFirstName] is still stubbornly refusing to accept Tzeentch as [From.GetHerHis] new Master. For some reason [From.GetSheHe] does not understand how only the uncontested Lord of Magic could grant [From.GetHerHim] the power you have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90003;[From.GetFirstName] is still rudely rejecting Nurgle's love. The Lord of the Flies is magnanimous and will keep bestowing his gifts, as will you, hoping in a change of heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90003;[From.GetFirstName] is still squeamish about the delights Slaanesh and you are presenting to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90003;Everyone comes around, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90004;It's hard to sleep after all your [GetFromRelation] warns you about everyday. Everyone is everyone's enemy. Power can be gained only through deceit and a cunning mind. You will only ever manage to learn magic from [From.GetHerHim] by stealing [From.GetHerHis] knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90004;It was a little disconcerting at starts, but having to not worry about cuts and illness is such a relief. Your [GetFromRelation]'s god is truly a kind and generous Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90004;It's hard to understand half of the things your [GetFromRelation] tells and does to you, but you've started to gain more and more curiosity as you experienced the delights offered by the Dark Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90004;But what about spells?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice90005;[From.GetFirstName] has finally decided to spare some time to teach you about mustering control over the Winds of Chaos. Most of it is still gibberish to you, but you cannot do much about it, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90005;What does this mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90007;The Changer of Ways has seen fit to bless your pupil with power over reality, as you knew he would. Your [GetFromRelation] is set up on a path to greatness. In fact, maybe you were to generous to the little brat. What if [From.GetSheHe] becomes a threat to your plans, now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90007;Grandfather Nurgle has bestowed a most precious gift upon your apprentice, allowing [From.GetHerHim] to finally have full control over the Winds of Chaos. Soon, your young new friends will share the love of the Lord of the Flies to many more unwilling people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90007;The Serpent is pleased with you and your pupil and has seen fit to grant [From.GetHerHim] a speck of his power to let [From.GetHerHis] fantasies grow wilder still.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90007;Success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90008;The plans of Tzeentch go beyond the comprehension of the rabble. Evidently your [GetFromRelation] was not gifted enough and when the Changer of Ways touched [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetHerHis] body and mind could not bear his awesome power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90008;Sadly, for once, Papa Nurgle might have been a little too generous: your [GetFromRelation] has collapsed beneath his many gifts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90008;Your [GetFromRelation] revealed [From.GetHerHim]self a failure. Your pupil just doesn't seem to have enough imagination for you or your Dark Prince's tastes, despite [From.GetHerHis] many despertate efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90008;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice10;A rush of power goes through your body each time you invoke one of Tzeentch's names, the Winds of Magic ready to bow to your every whim and warp reality at a mere gesture of your hands. Truly, your long years of study with [From.GetFirstName] have paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice10;Many gifts has Grandfather Nurgle bestowed upon you, but it finally came the time for magic to be amongst them. There so much you feel you can do right now and the Lord of the Flies is certain to give you all the time you could wish for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice10;Magic has finally come to you and you could barely spend any time sleeping in the past week: so much to experiment, so much to change and cut and sew with invisible fingers and unearthly precision. The Serpent has given you his greatest tool to express your art across the entire world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10;Finally! Power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice11;Graboliwayghsggrksukaeàfakjcsahxbghhhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice11;Papa Nurgle has blessed you just too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice11;Slaanesh is still unimpressed with you. It looks like you've lost his interest and won't become a mage any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice11;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos83005;Yes...', the vulture muttered, clawing at your shoulders. '...he doesn't need you... and you do not need him. Come with me, little soldier, I will show you how to lead...'\n\n'TRUE GLORY CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY FACING YOUR ENEMIES!!'\n\n'I can show you wondrous things and make reality itself bend to your whims.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos83005;Show me your world, o Changer of Ways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos83005;Then take away the stain of magic, Lord of Skulls, so that I may serve you better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13006;You forced your prisoner [imprisoned_mage.GetName] to share the secrects of magic with you. You hope that it will suffice to obtain the understanding of mysteries of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13005;Grrlllcht...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice14;It's been hard trying to figure it all out with no materials, no school, no master, but you've made it: you can feel your power and call upon it using the proper words and gestures. You are finally a mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13006;It is time to practice..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice14;You've tried your best, but without a Master you're just running blind. There's no way you'll ever learn magic this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice14;Teachings of your prisoner proven to be useful, every secret you stolen from [imprisoned_mage.GetHerHim] made you stronger. Now you can feel your power and call upon it using the proper words and gestures. You are finally a mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice14;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice14;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons1;As the executioner approaches, the daemon spits a curse in the dark tongue and disappears in a flash, leaving no trace behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons1;Hopefully the headman's axe scared it off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons2;No cell can hold a creature of the warp. A few words and reality bends to facilitate your escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons2;Free again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons3;There are so many mortals to play with. So sad they are so easy to break.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons3;There's more where this came from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons4;You've rallied an experienced group of hunters, hoping they will manage to track and destroy the evil creature infesting your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons4;Go forth and bring me its head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons40001;The hunters have returned to you with the head of the wretched daemon. Your realm is finally free of its evil presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons40001;Rejoice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons40002;The hunters tried their best, but the daemon eluded their traps. It left only their mangled remains as a warning against future attempts to eliminate it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons40002;Hmm... hopefully we have reserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons5;The minds of the mortals are easy to manipulate and you take a special delight in pitting those clueless fools one against the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons5;Yeah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons50001;Sometimes you cannot just stand the sight of your friends and colleagues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons50001;I hate you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons6;There are so many people waiting to receive the gifts of the Lord of the Flies. And you have plenty to give yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons6;Gloorrrgh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons60001;You've been feeling rather sick, when suddenly horrible rashes and boils erupt from your skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons60001;Gh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons7;The mortals entangled themselves so beautifully with lust and lies. It takes only a little nudge to let the shroud unravel in a wondrous cascade of passion and violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons7;Glamorous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons70001;Each night you dream of your spouse in bed with someone else. Last night, you could see their faces, you are certain now this is no dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons70001;How could you!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons8;Isn't it wondrous to roam free in the lands to spread Chaos wherever and whenever you please?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons8;It sure is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15;Learning magic with no tutor nor organization of learned experts at your back is no easy task. Necromancy also has quite the bad reputation. How would you like to proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15;I need to buy more books and materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15;I'll experiment and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice15;I need to buy more books and materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice15;I'll experiment and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15001;The more your personal laboratory increases in size, the higher the chances of unlocking your true magical potential. But you've still a long way to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15001;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15002;You do not know exactly what you are doing, but you hope that by cautious observation of the trial and error method, you will come to understand the mysteries of the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15002;If only there was an easier way to find fresh corpses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15003;It is said that the secret of necromancy lies within the clutches of the undead. Yet, with the proper resources, you might be able to search for a copy of Nagash's books and reach enlightenment without the need to grovel at the feet of a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15003;I shall search for the book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15003;This is beneath me. My will already moves the dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice15003;I will ask my dread liege for assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice15003;I can manage on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15004;It has taken a considerable amount of time and money, but finally a copy of the Liber Mortis, written by the Great Necromancer, is within your hands. And yet, now that you can see the ancient book, you are not certain if you could handle the dark secrets hidden within its pages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15004;It's too late to turn back now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15004;I do not dare to open it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15005;The secrets within the works of Nagash might be unbearable for weaker minds, but they could not break your will or your thirst for knowledge. You've discovered more than you could possibly imagine within those old pages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15006;The secrets within the works of Nagash might be unbearable for weaker minds, but they could not break your will or your thirst for knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15006;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15007;You've learned much from the works of Nagash, but the cursed words have slowly wormed their way into your mind, giving you distorted visions of the future and horrid hallucinations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15007;No! Get it away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15008;The secrets of the book were too much for your mind to handle. The dark forces embedded within the cursed writings of the Great Necromancer destroyed your mind and left you a withered husk. Perhaps someone more fortunate will continue your work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15008;Hhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15009;As an ancient King of Nehekhara, the power of the dead is already entwined within your very essence. Thousands of servants awake at your command, answering to the call of their old master. Yet you cannot create more. Perhaps experimenting upon your undead subject might unlock the secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15009;It is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15009;I shall not harm my loyal servants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15010;Your undead servants have submitted to your wishes, allowing you to perform all sorts of experiments upon them. In the repetitive and orderly fashion, hallmark of the Nehekharan society, you've managed to slowly make progress with your studies. You finally start to see the merits of Nagash's methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15010;Good. Another hundred here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15011;Regardless of the countless servants spent and days of study and experimenting, the secret of Nagash's necromancy still eludes you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15011;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15012;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has gained an interest in necromancy. Clueless as [From.GetSheHe] is on the matters of death and unlife, [From.GetSheHe] has wisely decided to ask you for guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice15012;Sure, I will teach you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15012;I can teach you, but only if you abandon your gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15012;Let me kiss you and you shall know everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice15012;You're not worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15013;[From.GetFirstName] is interested in helping you uncover the secrets of the dark arts, but only if you forsake your gods and bow to the unliving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15013;As you command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15013;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15014;[From.GetFirstName] has accepted your terms and abandoned [From.GetHerHis] failed gods to follow you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15014;Good... Let me educate you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15015;[From.GetFirstName] has refused your terms, preferring to cling to [From.GetHerHis] failed gods rather than learn the secrets of eternal life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15015;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15016;[From.GetFirstName] has considered your request and decided to assist you, with no request on [From.GetHerHis] part.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15016;A great gift, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15017;[From.GetFirstName] has accepted to help you, but only if you first allow [From.GetHerHim] to bestow upon you the dark gift. As it stands, [From.GetFirstName] assures you your studies will be much easier once you've become an immortal undead as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15017;A great opportunity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15017;I wish to control the dead, not be one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15018;Your [GetFromRelation] has accepted your terms and allowed you in [From.GetHerHis] chambers so that you could give [From.GetHerHim] the dark kiss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15019;Your [GetFromRelation] has stubbornly refused your gift, still too attached to [From.GetHerHis] fleeting life to see the wisdom in your offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15019;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15020;Sadly, [From.GetFirstName] has not considered you worthy of receiving [From.GetHerHis] ancient knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15020;On my own, then. As usual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice16;It's been hard trying to figure it all out with no materials, no school, no master, but you've made it, you're finally a necromancer. Through your will, the dead can walk and speak once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice16;You've tried your best, but without a guide you're just running blind. There's no way you'll ever learn the secrets of undeath this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice16;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice16;Damnation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice17;Your [GetFromRelation] has approached you, offering [From.GetHerHis] knowledge of the dark arts. For some reason [From.GetSheHe] believes you might become a powerful necromancer under [From.GetHerHis] guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice17;Sounds intriguing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice17;Not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice18;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has rejected your offer of power over death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice18;The fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19;Teaching necromancy is no easy task. There are many dangers waiting in the art of summoning the spirits of the dead and sparking a semblance of life within corpses. What should you have your apprentice focus their attention on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19;Caution is what's really important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice19;Daring is what a necromancer needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice19;Focus above everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice19;It is time to test [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you how a necromancer should be cautious. One should never be taken by surprise by how easily a spirit could break its chains or an horde lose its purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19001;I'll try and be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19002;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you how a necromancer should be bold and daring. You must harden yourself to the horrors you'll witness and never hesitate in your choices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19002;I will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19003;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you how a necromancer should always remain calm and maintain absolute discipline at all times, for it is a vital component for casting even the simplest spell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19003;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice19004;You've succeeded, you can feel the dark power flowing through your veins, compelling the dead to listen to your commands. You are a necromancer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice19004;Despite your best efforts, it seems necromancy is not the right thing for you. Your many years of study qualified you only for graverobbing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19004;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice19004;Damnations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has exceeded your expectations. Under [From.GetHerHis] will, the dead walk again. Your work is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20005;It would seem your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has taken a dark path and mastered the art of necromancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20005;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20006;[From.GetFirstName] revealed [From.GetHerHim]self to be a failure. Despite your efforts, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem capable of mastering the dark arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20006;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20007;It would seem your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]'s attempts at mastering the art of Necromancy ended in failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20007;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslunacy40;You thought you could live with it, but never growing old, never being an adult has turned your unlife into a curse. Are you even meant to think these things? You are still a child, after all. You will always be a child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy40;I want new toys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy41;Nothing, nothing excites you any longer. Your vampiric senses allow you to perceive any smell, any touch to its fullest, but you've satiated yourself with all the world had to offer to you. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAslunacy43;It's a warm day and, even in your palace, you feel uncomfortable. You long for the cold embrace of your dear mother. Once you approach her to ask for some hours of cuddling, you also realize you feel somewhat hungry and your eyes fall eerily on her breasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAslunacy43005;Your spawn, trapped in a childish body and devolved into a childish mind has come to you today, asking for some affection. As [From.GetSheHe] throws [From.GetHerHim]self on you, [From.GetHerHis] fangs already try and find a way towards your chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCBslunacy44;It was already hard being with an eternal child, but recently your love has started to act more and more like one.

EVTOPTAslunacy44;I can't love a child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslunacy44;This was never about love anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslunacy44;Actually, this is kind of intriguing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy44001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been acting strangely lately, avoiding you all the time. When pressured, [From.GetFirstName] admitted that [From.GetSheHe] cannot love a child like you appear to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslunacy44001;Fine! I don't want your cooties anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy44002;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been acting strangely lately, avoiding you all the time. Not that you really care about a grown-up like [From.GetHerHim], but it is annoying to not having [From.GetHerHim] around when you need [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy44002;I'm hungry! Fetch me someone to drink!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy44003;You felt a little weird when your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] shared bed with you today after so long. You weren't sure about it, but some of the funny things [From.GetSheHe] did with you were quite pleasing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy44003;Do we do it again tomorrow?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy45;The more you try new things to stimulate your senses, the more you grow accustomed to excesses and depravities. You have grown to have quite the reputation amongst your fellow aristocrats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy45;Who cares? I want more! I can barely feel anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46;Your skin feels cold and stale, your mind is feverish for the need of new sensations. What can you do to appease your desire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTDslunacy46;Anything! Just... just anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46001;What does it matter how deep you cut with your nails and fangs? You can already see your wounds healing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46001;It's useless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46002;You feed and feed upon a dozen or so different victims, some provided by the servants, some willingly submitting to your grasp. But even after you're wallowed in their blood, you feel nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46002;More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46003;Blood is not enough to placate your desire, so you start taking pieces of meat from your victims as well, gorging on the flesh of the living against all your instincts. The repulsion you feel is dim, but at least it is something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46003;More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46004;There's always some young thrall around, too young to have dignity, too eager to rise to care about shame, but ravaging their body gives you no pleasure. There is no itch, not the way the mortals feel, not way some of the other aristocrats claim to feel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46004;Why can't I feel it!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46005;You needed something different from another cold body to rub over yours, but the warmth of the servant you pinned on your bed does not make you feel any passion, just a mild annoying thirst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslunacy46006;A mortal is just some cattle, a vampire another cold body without any passion in it. You thought a ghoul would be the middle ground where you could find a little excitement, but the pitiful creature is nothing but cattle with a worse stench.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But the shambling rotting body has no fire within it, all the actions you order it to take resonate hollow within your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47007;Useless sack of bones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47008;You dance around the shadow, looking at the first burns, then daring your eyes up in the clean sky. The rush of fear and repulsion runs through your body, shrieking for you to hide inside, but you move another step forward, inebriated by that terror and the smell of your own flesh burning under the sunlight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47008;Ahhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47009;The chains twist your limbs, while the hooks slowly tear out pieces of your flesh. Soon, the wounds will close and then the pain will go away, allowing that new sensation to come about, the weird feeling of having healed parts dislocated from their correct position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47009;Ahhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47010;The twin-tailed comet, the hammer of Sigmar, looking at them feels you with fear and just for that you feel compelled to go against your instincts and place your hands on the holy symbols, reveling on the pain and revulsion summoned by Nagash's curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47010;I can almost feel him chant the spell...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47011;You take your arm out of the river, noting how the running water withered and corroded your perfect pale flesh. It is an intriguing sensation, one mortals could not describe. It is not like being burned, but it has a similar effect. As you watch your exposed bones, you immerse the arm once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47011;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy48;There is nothing and no-one for you to live for anymore. And yet, you remain in this eternal life, condemned to live until after the end of times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy48;Why can't I die?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy49;There was a time when you were a greater person. When your servants knew how to properly respect their betters, when you could dream of conquests and exquisite endeavors. Yet it is all gone, your life now but a hollow memory of what it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy49;The past... is all I have left...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy49001;You feel like the world holds no interest for you anymore. You have no longer place in it and thus, you slowly fall into hibernation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy49001;I'll dream of what was...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy49005;You suddenly feel something, as if the unlife as unmoving corpse could be worst of what you left, however little it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy49005;It is time to wake! I am back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslunacy49005;No... no... I will sleep, for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAhuntdown2102;Hnnnmpf..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2103;The hellhounds of the Daemon Prince are after your squad, yelling and growling, their echoes reverbering on the metallic walls of the sanctuary. You can see the Daemon awaiting, swords at hand, on its throne, but you must get through its minions first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBhuntdown2103;Nurglings crawls all over your bodies, trying to sink their infective teeth in your flesh, as you slowly advance in the miasmic swamp. It is only after a while you realize the hill ahead of you is really the Daemon Prince of Nurgle, awaiting to embrace you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCmagicpotential12008;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has ruled against your favour: the Ice Witches apprehend you and use their spells to permanently sever you from the Winds of Magic. Men where never meant to wield these powers, for your insolence you will lose much more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential12009;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has ruled in your favour, yet your existence is a threat to pristine flow of Ice magic or so Ice Witches think - you won't be forgotten...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential13;Your studies have been recently disturbed by waves of unknown magic. You've followed the interferences to what appears to be an unsanctioned female scholar. Women are forbidden to read and study magic, as the Prophets teach they more easily fall to the corruption of the undead. It is your duty to apprehend this traitor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential13;I'll confront her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential13005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] discovered of your forbidden studies and has decided to confront you. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCmagicpotential13006;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been exposed as an unsanctioned witch. By learning to read and tapping into the holy fire of Ormazd, she risk corrupting both herself and your lands. It is your duty to stop her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsrandoms1001;Gud ladz!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms1002;Disconcerting news from the South: a great tide of greenskins has swept through many of the northern provinces of the Southlands. The victories have increased the momentum of the goblin raiders, whose ranks keep growing every day. If they're not stopped quickly, they drown all of the human realms of Greater Araby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms1002;Something must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLEsrandoms2;Sudenburg's Corruption;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms2;For too long Sudenburg has lingered at the edge of the abyss, indolently sliding towards the pit of corruption under the perverted lead of decadent rulers. This once mighty city was built on the very ashes of the heathens burned by the first Knight-Captain to reach Araby, only another great cleansing can save it from eternal damnation.\n You couldn't have come at worst time, if your own predecessor, a Templar of Sigmar, had been corrupted by the vile undead lurking the swamps of Aruk, then anyone could be compromised. As you run through the reports of your Brother-Knights, your main concern is the despicable friendliness the Graf of Sudenburg seems to share with his neighbors of Olohrad. If the ruler Sudenburg openly intermingles with this heathens, is it any surprise his subjects feel so encouraged to walk into the lures of the undead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms2;I will investigate on the Graf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms2;I will investigate on Olohrad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsrandoms2;I will focus on something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLEsrandoms2001;The Graf's Son;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms2001;Heathens as they were, the Bretonnian Crusaders at least knew how to face the repulsive lures of witches and warlocks. Not only has Graf Marcellus maintained friendly relationships with the Akghans of Olohrad and the fanatic slavers of Al-Anaim, he has given his own and only son Timo as a husband to the daughter of the Bunda King. \n You are fairly certain the barbarian wife has charmed the heir of Sudenburg in some way. If he's allowed to succeed his father, it could be seen as further encouragement for the peasants to mix the races and acquire the wicked customs of the Southlanders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms2001;It must not be. He must be disposed of, at any cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms2001;He's still the Graf's son. I'll look for some other way;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLEsrandoms2002;The Witch-Doctors of Olohrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms2002;You've spent some time in Olohrad under cover, but your investigation has given you more doubts than clarity. The people of Olohrad seem to believe they are the only defenders against the darkness coming from the South, as if, by using the despicable sorcery of the undead, they were fighting them.\n Such is the hypocricy of sinners. Nevertheless, the Akghani witch-doctors might be a useful source of information against your main foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms2002;Maybe I can learn something;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms2002;The very thought is sinful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms2004;You've the chance to talk with [From.GetTitledFirstName] a few times now. You've often doubted [From.GetHerHis] word, believing [From.GetSheHe] was just patronizing you for half the time, possibly seeing through your disguise. Yet, [From.GetSheHe] has proven useful in better understanding the nature of your undead enemies. As misguided as they can be, these witch-doctors have allegedly been fighting the vampires of the Southlands for centuries, it would be unwise to squander their knowledge on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms2004;No, I will not be tempted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms2004;I suppose I can use them, for the moment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms3001;[From.GetFirstName] has been disposed of and you can rest easier. With his death, you hope the Graf will be forced to distance himself from Olohrad and the other decadent city-states, restricting trade deals and tightening the borders. All of this will make easier for you to investigate in Sudenburg itself and will help the city in the long term to maintain its identity and purity of faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms3001;Sigmar willing, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms4;Since your birth, a ravenous hunger has filled your mind and cramped your belly. As you are growing, this unending urge seems to be growing even further, regardless of how much you eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms4;More! More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms4;No! I'm sick of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91;You thought you would share eternity with your lover, but not that you would share your lover with others. This must stop, either it's yours only or nobody's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91;Give ultimatum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires91;I can share;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91001;[From.GetFirstName] is tired of sharing you with your other lovers. Either you pick [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHim] only to the end of times, or [From.GetSheHe] will leave forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91001;Of course I love you only!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires91001;There's the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91002;[From.GetFirstName] lied to you: [From.GetSheHe] never really loved, [From.GetSheHe] would rather spend [From.GetHerHis] days wrapped in the cold arms of other undead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91002;I HATE you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91003;[From.GetFirstName] understood [From.GetHerHis] error and promised you to send all of [From.GetHerHis] other lovers away and be with you to the end of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91003;Finally alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91004;The vicious [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has managed to charm [FromFrom.GetHerHis] way into convincing your beloved [From.GetFirstName] to leave you for [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91004;I'll make [FromFrom.GetHerHim] regret it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

#Generic
druchii_artifact_hydra_blade;Hydra Blade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_hydra_blade_desc;The Hydra Blade was carved from a single fang of Akholrak, first and greatest of the War Hydras broken to Malekith's service, and like its many-headed namesake, its keen edge srikes repeatedly against its foes. Though Akholrak is dead now, torn asunder long ago by the talons of the great Caledorian Dragon Incalamir, its malice lives on within this gnarled and twisted sword. Only those of iron will can hope to dominate the Hydra Blade, for it is imbued with an echo of Aholrak's malice and is little inclined to suffer the commands of another. Most wielders discover the blade's wilfulness more than offset by its alacrity, but more than a few have perished needlessly in encounters where skill would have served them far better than speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_chillblade;Chillblade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_chillblade_desc;When Malekith obliterated the northern citadel of Har Kaldra, he offered neither warning nor quarter. The iron-clad fortress was blasted to rime-scarred splinters with a single cataclysmic spell. Ever after, the freezing north wind has wailed with the agonised voices of those who perished that day, and its chill grasp can be held at bay by neither fur nor flame. It was from scattered shards of Har Kaldra that the Chillblade was forged. Its merest touch freezes not only the physical body but also the soul within, leaving the victim paralysed and easy prey for his attacks' next strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_black_dragon_egg;Black Dragon Egg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_black_dragon_egg_desc;In Ulthuan, the egg of a Dragon is sacred, and harsh punishment awaits any who endanger or disturb a Dragon nest. In Naggaroth, a Dragon egg is naught but a potential source of power, and their nests nothing but cradles to nurture that power. So it is that for every Black Dragon Egg that develops into a hatchling, countless dozens more are taken and consumed, so that their devourers might take a portion of the egg's strength as their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_twilight_cloak;Cloak of Twilight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_twilight_cloak_desc;Woven from the hair of innocents and dyed with the blood of sorcerers, the Cloak of Twilight is all but invisible to the mortal eye. The cloak has served many masters well across the long centuries. It was this garb that allowed Morathi to keep a close watch on the Phoenix Court of Bel Shanaar, even from Nagarythe. Centuries later, it had passed from the Hag Sorceress' hands and became the tool that allowed the master assassin, Venomblade, to stalk the blood-slicked streets of Tor Elyr as he visited his night of Screaming Death upon the folk of that great city. Ownership of the Cloak of Twilight guarantees an ambitious Dark Elf the success he craves, but is not without risk. However determined its wearer, there is always a more ruthless pretender, his mind set to steal the cloak's power for his own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_black_amulet;The Black Amulet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_black_amulet_desc;Carved from the tortured heartstone of a mountain drenched in Dark Magic, the Black Amulet is a lustrous polished stone of midnight hue. It is engraved with a single glowing rune, and into its ebony facets have been poured all the captured malice and spite that emanates from the chill lands of Naggaroth. To behold its darksome shape is to see despair made physical, it is to abandon even the merest memory of hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_hotek_ring;Ring of Hotek;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_hotek_ring_desc;Hotek was an outcast priest of Vaul. It was he who forged Malekith's rune-etched armour, and he also oversaw the creation of many of the Witch King's most terrible weapons. Renegade and turncoat though he was, Hotek was no fool. He knew that he lived only at Malekith's fickle pleasure, and so created for himself an armoury of defences - both magical and physical - with which he hoped to blunt the Witch King's wrath long enough to escape. Ultimately, Hotek did not perish at Malekith's hands, but was poisoned on Morathi's order. His armoury was broken up soon after, the scattered pieces changing hands with the ebb and flow of patronage and power. None of the artefacts have known as many masters as the Ring of Hotek, for this trinket of obsidian and black diamond is claimed to be the renegade priest's greatest work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_nagarythe_banner;Banner of Nagarythe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_nagarythe_banner_desc;During the sundering, many of Nagarythe's treasures were lost in battle or destroyed by natural disaster. Those that remained were greedily seized upon by nobles of both allegiances. Some fell into the hands of the Aesanar, who hid them away from Malekith's forces, but the most important were taken by the Dark Elves. The Banner of Nagarythe is the greatest of all such treasures, woven through with silver thread and inlaid with pearls and diamonds. For the Dark Elves, the Banner of Nagarythe is a physical reminder of the injustices heaped upon them by the Phoenix Throne. Moreover, it is the personal standard of the Witch King and proclaims his right to rule not only Naggaroth, but the ten kingdoms of Ulthuan as well. For their part, the Shadow Warriros of Nagarythe deem this banner too mired in corruption and betrayal to any longer have any wholesome purpose. They seek not its return, but its destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_spite_gem;The Gem of Spite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_spite_gem_desc;Many Dark Elves feel that a misfortune shared, if not exactly a misfortune havled, then at least one in which they can take a certain malignant (and possible posthumous) glee. Such was the goal behind the creation of the Gem of Spite. It was fashioned during a rare civil war in Ghrond, when sorceress fought sorceress in an attempt to claim a place at Morathi's right hand. The Gem of Spite still turns up from time to time, normally in the possession of one who has fallen from the Hag Sorceress' favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_sacrificial_dagger;The Sacrificial Dagger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_sacrificial_dagger_desc;This dagger is a tiny splinter of the cruel weapon wielded by Hekarti, Goddess of Dark Magic. It was shivered from her blade during a failed attempt to sacrifice her sister, Atharti, to an older and darker power than she. The shard was flung far and came to rest in the caverns beneath Ghrond. Here, amongst the bleached bones and rubble, itwas discovered by Khaeleth the Sorceress. She claimed the dagger as her own and learned how to unlock its power to transmute the soul-essence of living creatures into a raw and hungry magic. So began Khaeleth's rise to the foremost seat of power within the Dark Convent of Ghrond, an elevation marked by blood sacrifice and the darkest of sorceries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_tome_furion;Tome of Furion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_tome_furion_desc;Dark Magic is destruction incarnate - even it most basic precepts are corrosive to mind, body and soul. Few tomes containing its secrets therefore exist, for mere paper and papyrus smoulder to naught within decades of being inked with such sigils. THe tome of Furion is a rare exception to this rule. Its pages are flayed Orc hide, but the book endures its burdens thanks only to the carefully layered enchantments Furion bound into its covers. The letters inscribed within writhe and shift like living creatures, and the pages are warm to the touch even in the dead of winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
