pirate_government;Pirate Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pirate_government_desc;Pirate fleets are alliances of multiple pirate crews banded together under a common flag and a single leader they have chosen to follow for strength of numbers, loyalty, or just a demonstrated ability of their elected leader to gather booty. The collection of crews within the fleet are of diverse nature, being seabound bandits, professional privateers working for the benefit of another, merchants deciding to pay in steel and shot instead of gold and silver, or even the military of a realm itself engaged in plundering their political rivals. The individual crews within the fleet are highly autonomous and come to the aid of their leader when called upon to put together a mightly piratical armada under the black flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
